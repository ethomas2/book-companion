One need only look at the aftermath of his brief visit to Sel to see proof of what I say. Kaladin didnt want to open his eyes. If he opened his eyes, hed be awake. And if he were awake, that painthe burning in his side, the aching of his legs, the dull throb in his arms and shoulderswouldnt be just a nightmare. It would be real. And it would be his. He stifled a groan, rolling onto his side. It all ached. Every length of muscle, every inch of skin. His head pounded. It seemed that his very bones were sore. He wanted to lie motionless and throbbing until Gaz was forced to come and tow him out by his ankles. That would be easy. Didnt he deserve to do what was easy, for once? But he couldnt. To stop moving, to give up, would be the same as dying, and he could not let that happen. Hed made his decision already. He would help the bridgemen. Curse you, Hav, he thought. You can boot me out of my bunk even now . Kaladin threw off his blanket, forcing himself to stand. The door to the barrack was cracked open to let in fresh air. He felt worse standing up, but the life of a bridgeman wouldnt wait for him to recover. You either kept up or you got crushed. Kaladin steadied himself, hand against the unnaturally smooth, Soulcast rock of the barrack wall. Then he took a deep breath and crossed the room. Oddly, more than a few of the men were awake and sitting up. They watched Kaladin in silence. They were waiting, Kaladin realized. They wanted to see if Id get up. He found the three wounded where hed left them at the front of the barrack. He held his breath as he checked on Leyten. Amazingly, he was still alive. His breathing was still shallow, his pulse weak and his wounds dire, but he was alive.
