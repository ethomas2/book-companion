Kaladins eyes snapped open. The gathered bridgemen gasped, several cursing and falling to the ground, splashing in the pools of rainwater. Kaladin drew in a ragged breath, wheezing, eyes staring forward, intense and unseeing. He exhaled, blowing flecks of bloody spittle out over his lips. His hand, hanging below him, slipped open. Something dropped to the stones. The sphere Teft had given him. It splashed into a puddle and stopped there. It was dun, no Stormlight in it. What in the name of Kelek? Teft thought, kneeling. You left a sphere out in the storm, and it gathered Stormlight. Held in Kaladins hand, this one should have been fully infused. What had gone wrong?  Umalakaiki ! Rock bellowed, pointing.  Kama mohoray namavau  He stopped, realizing he was speaking the wrong language. Somebody be helping me get him down! Is still alive! We need ladder and knife! Hurry! The bridgemen scrambled. The soldiers approached, muttering, but they didnt stop the bridgemen. Sadeas himself had declared that the Stormfather would choose Kaladins fate. Everyone knew that meant death. ExceptTeft stood up straight, holding the dun sphere. An empty sphere after a storm, he thought. And a man whos still alive when he should be dead. Two impossibilities. Together they bespoke something that should be even more impossible. Wheres that ladder! Teft found himself yelling. Curse you all, hurry, hurry! We need to get him bandaged. Somebody go fetch that salve he always puts on wounds! He glanced back at Kaladin, then spoke much more softly. And youd better survive, son. Because I want some answers.
