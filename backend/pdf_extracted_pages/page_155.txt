The youth, the one that reminded him of Tien, died during the very next bridge run. It was a bad one. The Parshendi were in position, waiting for Sadeas. Kaladin charged the chasm, not even flinching as men were slaughtered around him. It wasnt bravery that drove him; it wasnt even a wish that those arrows would take him and end it all. He ran. That was what he did. Like a boulder rolled down a hill, or like rain fell from the sky. They didnt have a choice. Neither did he. He wasnt a man; he was a thing, and things just did what they did. The bridgemen laid their bridges in a tight line. Four crews had fallen. Kaladins own team had lost nearly enough stop them. Bridge placed, Kaladin turned away, the army charging across the wood to start the real battle. He stumbled back across the plateau. After a few moments, he found what he was looking for. The boys body. Kaladin stood, wind whipping at his hair, looking down at the corpse. It lay faceup in a small hollow in the stone. Kaladin remembered lying in a similar hollow, holding a similar corpse. Another bridgeman had fallen nearby, bristling with arrows. It was the man whod lived through Kaladins first bridge run all those weeks back. His body slumped to the side, lying on a stone outcropping a foot or so above the corpse of the boy. Blood dripped from the tip of an arrow sticking out his back. It fell, one ruby drop at a time, splattering on the boys open, lifeless eye. A little trail of red ran from the eye down the side of his face. Like crimson tears. That night, Kaladin huddled in the barrack, listening to a highstorm buff et the wall. He curled against the cold stone. Thunder shattered the sky outside. I cant keep going like this, he thought. Im dead inside, as sure as if Id taken a spear through the neck. The storm continued its tirade. And for the first time in a year, Kaladin found himself crying.
