Just dont glow too brightly while were trying to sleep, eh, gancho? Lopen said. Ill do my best. He took another spoonful of stew. It tasted better than usual. Had Rock changed the recipe? Or was it something else? As he settled back to eat, the other bridgemen began chatting, speaking of home and their pasts, things that had once been taboo. Several of the men from other crewswounded whom Kaladin had helped, even just a few lonely souls who were still awake wandered over. The men of Bridge Four welcomed them, handing over stew and making room. Everyone looked as exhausted as Kaladin felt, but nobody spoke of turning in. He could see why, now. Being together, eating Rocks stew, listening to the quiet chatter while the fire crackled and popped, sending dancing flakes of yellow light into the air This was more relaxing than sleep could be. Kaladin smiled, leaning back, looking upward toward the dark sky and the large sapphire moon. Then he closed his eyes, listening. Three more men were dead. Malop, Earless Jaks, and Narm. Kaladin had failed them. But he and Bridge Four had protected hundreds of others. Hundreds who would never have to run a bridge again, would never have to face Parshendi arrows, would never have to fight again if they didnt want to. More personally, twenty-seven of his friends lived. Partially because of what hed done, partially because of their own heroism. Twenty-seven men lived. Hed finally managed to save someone. For now, that was enough.
