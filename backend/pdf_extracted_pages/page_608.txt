Shallan stared at the note for a long time. Shed wanted to know where he was and when he was planning to return, but hed apparently taken her letter as a request to come and pick her up. It seemed a fitting deadline. That would put her departure at three weeks after stealing the Soulcaster, as shed told Nan Balat to expect. If Jasnah hadnt reacted to the Soulcaster switch by then, Shallan would have to take it to mean that she wasnt under suspicion. One week. She would be on that ship. It made her break inside to realize it, but it had to be done. She lowered the paper and left the guest hallway, her steps taking her through the twisting corridors into the Veil. Shortly, she stood outside Jasnahs alcove. The princess sat at her desk, reed scratching at a notebook. She glanced up. I thought I told you that you could do whatever you want today. You did, Shallan said. And I realized that what I want to do is study. Jasnah smiled in a sly, understanding way. Almost a self-satisfied way. If she only knew. Well, Im not going to chide you for that, Jasnah said, turning back to her research. Shallan sat, offering the bread and jam to Jasnah, who shook her head and continued researching. Shallan cut herself another slice and topped it with jam. Then she opened a book and sighed in satisfaction. In one week, shed have to leave. But in the meantime, she would let herself pretend a little while longer.
