his pride! I feel like a true man again. Here. This razor belongs not to me, but to us all. Any who wishes to use it must do so. Is my honor to share with you! The men laughed, and a few took him up on the offer. Kaladin wasnt one of them. It justdidnt seem to matter to him. He accepted the bowl of stew Dunny brought him, but didnt eat. Sigzil chose not to sit back down beside him, retreating to the other side of the campfire. Eyes of red and blue, Kaladin thought. I dont know if that fits us. For him to have eyes of red and blue, Kaladin would have to believe that there was at least a small chance the bridge crew could survive. This night, Kaladin had trouble convincing himself. Hed never been an optimist. He saw the world as it was, or he tried to. That was a problem, though, when the truth he saw was so terrible. Oh, Stormfather, he thought, feeling the crushing weight of despair as he stared down at his bowl. Im falling back to the wretch I was. Im losing my grip on this, on myself. He couldnt carry the hopes of all the bridgemen. He just wasnt strong enough.
