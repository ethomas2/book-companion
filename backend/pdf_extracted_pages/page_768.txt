A woman sits and scratches out her own eyes. Daughter of kings and winds, the vandal. Dated Palahevan, 1173, 73 seconds pre-death. Subject: a beggar of some renown, known for his elegant songs. One week after losing Dunny, Kaladin stood on another plateau, watching a battle proceed. This time, however, he didnt have to save the dying. Theyd actually arrived before the Parshendi. A rare but welcome event. Sadeass army was now holding out at the center of the plateau, protecting the chrysalis while some of his soldiers cut into it. The Parshendi kept leaping over the line and attacking the men working on the chrysalis. Hes getting surrounded, Kaladin thought. It didnt look good, which would mean a miserable return trip. Sadeass men were bad enough when, arriving second, they were rebuffed. Losing the gemheart after arriving first would leave them even more frustrated. Kaladin! a voice said. Kaladin spun to see Rock trotting up. Was someone wounded? Have you seen this thing? The Horneater pointed. Kaladin turned, following his gesture. Another army was approaching on an adjacent plateau. Kaladin raised eyebrows; the banners flapped blue, and the soldiers were obviously Alethi. A little late, arent they? Moash asked, standing beside Kaladin. It happens, Kaladin said. Occasionally another highprince would arrive after Sadeas got to the plateau. More often, Sadeas arrived first, and the other Alethi army had to turn around. Usually they didnt get this close before doing so. Thats the standard of Dalinar Kholin, Skar said, joining them. Dalinar, Moash said appreciatively. They say he doesnt use bridgemen.
