forthright, tell them the truth, andif anythingundervalue your goods. They will love you for it. And theyll pay you for it too. She nodded. They reached the wagon, and he got out a strange little pot. Here, he said. Use a knife and go cut out some of that grass. Be sure to cut down far and get plenty of the soil. The plants cant live without it. Why am I doing this? she asked, wrinkling her nose and taking the pot. Because, he said. Youre going to learn to care for that plant. I want you to keep it with you until you stop thinking of it as odd. But why? Because it will make you a better merchant, he said. She frowned. Must he be so strange so much of the time?

She did get out a rugged pair of gloves first, though, and roll up her sleeves. She was not going to ruin a good dress for a pot of drooling, wall-staring, imbecile grass. And that was that.
