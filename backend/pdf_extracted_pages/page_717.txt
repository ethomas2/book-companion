Im thinking of changing my Calling, Ashir said from behind. Geranid nodded absently as she worked on her equations. The small stone room smelled sharply of spices. Ashir was trying another new experiment. It involved some kind of curry powder and a rare Shin fruit that hed caramelized. Something like that. She could hear it sizzling on his new fabrial hotplate. Im tired of cooking, Ashir continued. He had a soft, kindly voice. She loved him for that. Partially because he liked to talkand if you were going to have someone talk while you were attempting to think, they might as well have a soft, kindly voice. I dont have passion for it as I once did, he continued. Besides, what good will a cook be in the Spiritual Realm? Heralds need food, she said absently, scratching out a line on her writing board, then scribbling another line of numbers beneath it. Do they? Ashir asked. Ive never been convinced. Oh, Ive read the speculations, but it just doesnt seem rational to me. The body must be fed in the Physical Realm, but the spirit exists in a completely different state. A state of ideals, she replied. So, you could create ideal foods, perhaps. HmmWhat would be the fun in that? No experimentation. I could do without, she said, leaning forward to inspect the rooms hearth, where two flamespren danced on the logs fire. If it meant never again having to eat something like that green soup you made last month. Ah, he said, sounding wistful. That was something, wasnt it? Completely revolting, yet made entirely from appetizing ingredients. He seemed to consider it a personal triumph. I wonder if they eat in the Cognitive Realm. Is a food there what it sees itself as being? Ill have to read and see if anyone has ever eaten while visiting Shadesmar. Geranid responded with a noncommittal grunt, getting out her calipers and leaning closer to the heat to measure the flamespren. She frowned, then made another notation.
