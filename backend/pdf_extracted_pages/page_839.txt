that any kind of fairness applied to us? She hasnt killed us fast enough for Sadeas, Moash said. You know that soldiers have been beaten for coming to look for you, to see the man who survived the highstorm? He hasnt forgotten about you, Kaladin. Teft was still swearing. He pulled Kaladin aside, Lopen following, but the others remained talking among themselves. Damnation! Teft said softly. They like to pretend to be evenhanded with the bridge crews. Makes em seem fair. Looks like they gave up on that. Bastards. What do we do, gancho? Lopen asked. We go to the chasms, Kaladin said. Just like were scheduled to. Then make sure we get some extra sleep tonight, as were apparently going to be staying up all night tomorrow. The men will hate going into the chasms at night, lad, Teft said. I know. But were not ready for what we need to do, Teft said, looking to make sure nobody could hear. It was only him, Kaladin, and Lopen. It will be another few weeks at least. I know. We wont last another few weeks! Teft said. With Sadeas and Kholin working together, runs happen nearly every day. Just one bad runone time with the Parshendi drawing bead on usand it will all be over. Well be wiped out. I know! Kaladin said, frustrated, taking a deep breath and forming fists to keep himself from exploding. Gancho! Lopen said. What? Kaladin snapped. Its happening again. Kaladin froze, then looked down at his arms. Sure enough, he caught a hint of luminescent smoke rising from his skin. It was extremely fainthe didnt have many gemstones near himbut it was there. The wisps faded quickly. Hopefully the other bridgemen hadnt seen. Damnation. What did I do? I dont know, Teft said. Is it because you were angry at Hashal? I was angry before. You breathed it in, Syl said eagerly, whipping around him in the air, a ribbon of light. What? I saw it. She twisted herself around. You were mad, you drew in a breath, and the Light it came too.
