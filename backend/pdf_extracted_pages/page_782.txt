Light grows so distant. The storm never stops. I am broken, and all around me have died. I weep for the end of all things. He has won. Oh, he has beaten us. Dated Palahakev, 1173, 16 seconds pre-death. Subject: a Thaylen sailor. Dalinar fought, the Thrill pulsing within him, swinging his Shardblade from atop Gallants back. Around him, Parshendi fell with eyes burning black. They came at him in pairs, each team trying to hit him from a different direction, keeping him busy andthey hopeddisoriented. If a pair could rush at him while he was distracted, they might be able to shove him off his mount. Those axes and macesswung repeatedlycould crack his Plate. It was a very costly tactic; corpses lay scattered around Dalinar. But when fighting against a Shardbearer, every tactic was costly. Dalinar kept Gallant moving, dancing from side to side, swinging his Blade in broad sweeps. He stayed just a little ahead of the line of his men. A Shardbearer needed space to fight; the Blades were so long that hurting ones companions was a very real danger. His honor guard would approach only if he fell or encountered trouble. The Thrill excited him, strengthened him. He hadnt experienced the weakness again, the nausea he had on the battlefield that day weeks ago. Perhaps hed been worried about nothing. He turned Gallant just in time to confront two pairs of Parshendi coming at him from behind, singing softly. He directed Gallant with his knees, performing an expert sweeping side-swing, cutting through the necks of two Parshendi, then the arm of a third. Eyes burned out in the first two, and they collapsed. The third dropped his weapon from a hand that grew suddenly lifeless, flopping down, its nerves all severed.
