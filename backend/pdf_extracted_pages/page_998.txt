No. We need to get to the center of it all. She looked at Shallan. Were going to the Shattered Plains. We need to find out if the Parshendi were ever ordinary parshmen, and if so, what set them off. Perhaps I am wrong about this, but if I am right, then the Parshendi could hold the key to turning ordinary parshmen into soldiers. Then, grimly, she continued. And we need to do it before someone else does, then uses it against us. Someone else? Shallan asked, feeling a sharp stab of panic. There are others looking for this? Of course there are. Who do you think went to so much trouble trying to have me assassinated? She reached into a stack of papers on her desk. I dont know much about them. For all I know, there are many groups searching for these secrets. I know of one for certain, however. They call themselves the Ghostbloods. She pulled out a sheet. Your friend Kabsal was one. We found their symbol tattooed on the inside of his arm. She set the sheet down. On it was a symbol of three diamonds in a pattern, overlapping one another. It was the same symbol that Nan Balat had shown her weeks ago. The symbol worn by Luesh, her fathers steward, the man who had known how to use the Soulcaster. The symbol worn by the men who had come, pressuring her family to return it. The men who had been financing Shallans father in his bid to become highprince. Almighty above, Shallan whispered. She looked up. Jasnah, I think I think my father might have been a member of this group.
