names, hed give them fake names back. And you, Temoo? Blunt snapped. We cant pontificate our way to Gentlemen, Thinker said. He nodded to Ishikk, who was still slurping his soup. All three of them switched to another language and continued their argument. Ishikk listened with half an ear, trying to determine what language it was. He never had been good with other kinds of languages. Why did he need them? Didnt help with fishing or selling fish. He had searched for their man. He got around a lot, visited a lot of places around the Purelake. It was one of the reasons why he didnt want to be caught by Maib. Hed have to settle down, and that wasnt good for catching fish. Not the rare ones, at least. He didnt bother wondering why they were looking for this Hoid, whoever he was. Foreigners were always looking for things they couldnt have. Ishikk sat back, dangling his toes in the water. That felt good. Eventually, they finished their argument. They gave him some more instructions, handed him a pouch of spheres, and stepped down into the water. Like most foreigners, they wore thick boots that came all the way up to their knees. They splashed in the water as they walked to the entrance. Ishikk followed, waving to Maib and picking up his buckets. Hed be back later in the day for an evening meal. Maybe I should let her catch me, he thought, stepping back out into the sunlight and sighing in relief. Nu Ralik knows Im getting old. Might be nice to relax. His foreigners splashed down into the Purelake. Grump was last. He seemed very dissatisfied. Where are you, Roamer? What a fools quest this is. Then, he added in his own tongue, Alavanta kamaloo kayana. He splashed after his companions. Well, youve got the fool part right, Ishikk said with a chuckle, turning his own direction and heading off to check on his traps.
