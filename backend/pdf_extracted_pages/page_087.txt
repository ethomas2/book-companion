even make wages! That much was true. When worked, slaves had to be paid a small wage half what a nonslave would be paid, which was already often less than a full citizen would make for the same work. But it was something, and Alethi law required it. Only ardentswho couldnt own anything anywaydidnt have to be paid. Well, them and parshmen. But parshmen were more animal than anything else. A slave could apply his earnings to his slave debt and, after years of labor, earn his freedom. Theoretically. The others continued to chatter as the wagons rolled down the incline, but Kaladin withdrew to the back of the wagon. He suspected that the option to pay off a slaves price was a sham, intended to keep slaves docile. The debt was enormous, far more than a slave sold for, and virtually impossible to earn out. Under previous masters, hed demanded his wages be given to him. They had always found ways to cheat himcharging him for his housing, his food. Thats how lighteyes were. Roshone, Amaram, KatarotamEach lighteyes Kaladin had known, whether as a slave or a free man, had shown himself to be corrupt to the core, for all his outward poise and beauty. They were like rotting corpses clothed in beautiful silk. The other slaves kept talking about the kings army, and about justice. Justice? Kaladin thought, resting back against the bars. Im not convinced there is such a thing as justice. Still, he found himself wondering. That was the kings armythe armies of all ten highprincescome to fulfill the Vengeance Pact. If there was one thing he still let himself long for, it was the chance to hold a spear. To fight again, to try and find his way back to the man he had been. A man who had cared. If he would find that anywhere, hed find it here.
