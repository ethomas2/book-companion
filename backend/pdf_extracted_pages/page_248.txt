SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS AGO He wants to send me to Kharbranth, Kal said, perched atop his rock. To train to become a surgeon. What, really ? Laral asked, as she walked across the edge of the rock just in front of him. She had golden streaks in her otherwise black hair. She wore it long, and it streamed out behind her in a gust of wind as she balanced, hands out to the sides. The hair was distinctive. But, of course, her eyes were more so. Bright, pale green. So different from the browns and blacks of the townspeople. There really was something different about being a lighteyes. Yes, really, Kal said with a grunt. Hes been talking about it for a couple of years now. And you didnt tell me? Kal shrugged. He and Laral were atop a low ridge of boulders to the east of Hearthstone. Tien, his younger brother, was picking through rocks at the base. To Kals right, a grouping of shallow hillsides rolled to the west. They were sprinkled with lavis polyps, a planting halfway to being harvested. He felt oddly sad as he looked over those hillsides, filled with working men. The dark brown polyps would grow like melons filled with grain. After being dried, that grain would feed the entire town and their highprinces armies. The ardents who passed through town were careful to explain that the Calling of a farmer was a noble one, one of the highest save for the Calling of a soldier. Kals father whispered under his breath that he saw far more honor in feeding the kingdom than he did in fighting and dying in useless wars. Kal? Laral said, voice insistent. Why didnt you tell me? Sorry, he said. I wasnt sure if Father was serious or not. So I didnt say anything.
