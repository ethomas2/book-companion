stepped forward. I want to know , Jasnah. I want to be your ward in truth. Whatever the source of this thing you can do, I can do it too. I want you to train me and let me be part of your work. You stole from me. I know, Shallan said. And Im sorry. Jasnah raised an eyebrow. I wont excuse myself, Shallan said. But Jasnah, I came here intending to steal from you. I was planning it from the beginning. Thats supposed to make me feel better? I planned to steal from Jasnah the bitter heretic, Shallan said. I didnt realize Id come to regret the need for that theft. Not just because of you, but because it meant leaving this . What Ive come to love. Please. I made a mistake. A large one. Insurmountable. Dont make a larger one by sending me away. I can be someone you dont have to lie to. Someone who knows. Jasnah sat back. I stole the fabrial on the night you killed those men, Jasnah, Shallan said. Id decided I couldnt do it, but you convinced me that truth was not as simple as I thought it. Youve opened a box full of storms in me. I made a mistake. Ill make more. I need you. Jasnah took a deep breath. Sit down. Shallan sat. You will never lie to me again, Jasnah said, raising a finger. And you will never steal from me, or anyone, again. I promise. Jasnah sat for a moment, then sighed. Scoot over here, she said, pulling open a book. Shallan obeyed as Jasnah took out several sheets filled with notes. What is this? Shallan asked. You wanted to be part of what Im doing? Well, youll need to read this. Jasnah looked down at the notes. Its about the Voidbringers.
