others wont bring him back. He lost the one hed suspected would die, but saved the other four, and the one whod taken a knock to the head was beginning to wake up. Kaladin sat back on his knees, weary, hands covered in blood. He washed them off with a stream of water from Lopens waterskins, then reached up, finally remembering his own wound, where the arrow had sliced his cheek. He froze. He prodded at his skin, but couldnt find the wound. He had felt blood on his cheek and chin. Hed felt the arrow slice him, hadnt he? He stood up, feeling a chill, and raised his hand to his forehead. What was happening? Someone stepped up beside him. Moashs now-clean-shaven face exposed a faded scar along his chin. He studied Kaladin. About Dunny You were right to do what you did, Kaladin said. You probably saved my life. Thank you. Moash nodded slowly. He turned to look at the four wounded men; Lopen and Dabbid were giving them drinks of water, asking their names I was wrong about you, Moash said suddenly, holding out a hand to Kaladin. Kaladin took the hand, hesitant. Thank you. Youre a fool and an instigator. But youre an honest one. Moash chuckled to himself. If you get us killed, it wont be on purpose. Cant say that for some Ive served under. Anyway, lets get these men ready for moving.
