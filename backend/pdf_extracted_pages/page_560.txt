Maybe, Kal said, shaking his head. But one thing hasnt changed. I want to go to Kharbranth. Even on stolen spheres? Ill find a way to pay them back. Not to Roshone. To Laral. Shell be a Roshone before too long, Lirin said. We should expect an engagement between her and Rillir before the year is out. Roshone will not let her slip away, not now that hes lost political favor in Kholinar. She represents one of the few chances his son has for an alliance with a good house. Kal felt his stomach turn at the mention of Laral. I have to learn. Perhaps I can Can what, he thought. Come back and convince her to leave Rillir for me? Ridiculous . He looked up suddenly at his father, who had bowed his head, looking sorrowful. He was a hero. A villain too. But a hero to his family. I wont tell Tien, Kal whispered. And Im going to use the spheres to travel to Kholinar and study. His father looked up. I want to learn to face lighteyes, like you do, Kal said. Any of them can make a fool of me. I want to learn to talk like them, think like them. I want you to learn so that you can help people, son. Not so you can get back at the lighteyes. I think I can do both. If I can learn to be clever enough. Lirin snorted. Youre plenty clever, son. Youve got enough of your mother in you to talk circles around a lighteyes. The university will show you how, Kal. I want to start going by my full name, he replied, surprising himself. Kaladin. It was a mans name. Hed always disliked how it sounded like the name of a lighteyes. Now it seemed to fit. He wasnt a darkeyed farmer, but he wasnt a lighteyed lord either. Something in between. Kal had been a child who wanted to join the army because it was what other boys dreamed of. Kaladin would be a man who learned surgery and all the ways of the lighteyes. And someday he would return to this town and prove to Roshone, Rillir, and Laral herself that they had been wrong to dismiss him. Very well, Lirin said. Kaladin.
