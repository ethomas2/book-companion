this day? Its simple, Jezrien said, walking away. We tell them that they finally won. Its an easy enough lie. Who knows? Maybe it will turn out to be true. Kalak watched Jezrien depart across the burned landscape. Finally, he summoned his own Blade and slammed it into the stone beside the other eight. He turned and walked in the direction opposite from Jezrien. And yet, he could not help glancing back at the ring of swords and the single open spot. The place where the tenth sword should have gone. The one of them who was lost. The one they had abandoned. Forgive us, Kalak thought, then left.
