glum, nephew. You learned something today. Your uncle doesnt want to kill you. He just wants to make me a target. For your own good, son, Dalinar said, walking to the door. Dont fret too much. Ive got some plans on how, exactly, to keep you alive. He opened the door, revealing a nervous group of guards keeping at bay a nervous group of servants and attendants. Hes just fine, Dalinar said to them. See? He stepped aside, letting the guards and servants in to attend their king. Dalinar turned to go. Then he hesitated. Oh, and Elhokar? Your mother and I are now courting. Youll want to start growing accustomed to that. Despite everything else that had happened in the last few minutes, this got a look of pure astonishment from the king. Dalinar smiled and pulled the door closed, walking away with a firm step. Most everything was still wrong. He was still furious at Sadeas, pained by the loss of so many of his men, confused at what to do with Navani, dumbfounded by his visions, and daunted by the idea of bringing the warcamps to unity. But at least now he had something to work with.
