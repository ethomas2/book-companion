form did slightly. It seemed locked somehow. It almost looked like a little person as it danced over the fire. She reached up and erased her notation. It immediately began pulsing and changing erratically like the other one. Wow, Ashir repeated. Its as if it knows, somehow, that it has been measured. As if merely defining its form traps it somehow. Write down a number. What number? Any number, he said. But one that might be the size of a flamespren. She did so. Nothing happened. You have to actually measure it, he said, tapping his spoon softly against the side of his bowl. No pretending. I wonder at the precision of the instrument, she said. If I use one that is less precise, will that give the spren more flexibility? Or is there a threshold, an accuracy beyond which it finds itself bound? She sat down, feeling daunted. I need to research this more. Try it for luminosity, then compare that to my general equation of flamespren luminosity as compared to the fire theyre drawn to dance around. Ashir grimaced. That, my dear, sounds a lot like math. Indeed. Then I shall make you a snack to occupy you while you create new marvels of calculation and genius. He smiled, kissing her forehead. You just found something wonderful, he said more softly. I dont know what it means yet, but it might very well change everything we understand about spren. And maybe even about fabrials. She smiled, turning back to her equations. And for once, she didnt mind at all as he began chatting about his ingredients, working out a new formula for some sugary confection he was sure shed love.
