Alethi standards, that was another thing entirely. He didnt want to risk the kingdom either. Sadeas wouldnt want outright war, and Dalinar couldnt afford outright war, despite his seething anger. He formed a fist, turning to look at the spearman. It will not turn to war, Dalinar said. Not yet, at least. Well, if thats the case, the spearman said, then by taking us into your camp, you commit robbery. The kings law, the Codes my men always claim you uphold, would demand that you return us to Sadeas. He wont let us go easily. I will take care of Sadeas, Dalinar said. Return with me. I vow that you will be safe. I promise it with every shred of honor I have. The young bridgeman met his eyes, searching for something. Such a hard man he was for one so young. All right, the spearman said. Well return. I cant leave my men back at camp andwith so many men now woundedwe dont have the proper supplies to run. The young man turned back to his work, and Dalinar rode Gallant in search of a casualty report. He forced himself to contain his rage at Sadeas. It was difficult. No, Dalinar could not let this turn to warbut neither could he let things go back to the way they had been. Sadeas had upset the balance, and it could never be regained. Not in the same way.
