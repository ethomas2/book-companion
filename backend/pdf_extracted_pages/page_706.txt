promising career. This foolish scheme will stain your life for decades. No woman will take you as a ward now. You threw it away . She shook her head in distaste. I hate being wrong. With that, she turned to leave. Shallan raised a hand. I have to apologize. I have to say something. Jasnah? The woman did not look back, and the guard did not return. Shallan curled up under the sheet, stomach in knots, feeling so sick thatfor a momentshe wished that shed actually dug that shard of glass in a little deeper. Or maybe that Jasnah hadnt been quick enough with the Soulcaster to save her. Shed lost it all. No fabrial to protect her family, no wardship to continue her studies. No Kabsal. Shed never actually had him in the first place. Her tears dampened the sheets as the sunlight outside faded, then vanished. Nobody came to check on her. Nobody cared.
