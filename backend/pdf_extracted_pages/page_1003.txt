I dont know who he is, but if he wants to do this , then I will fight him. Someone must lead them. I will do it, Dalinar said. The words just came out. Someone must unite them. I will do it. Someone must protect them. I will do it! The figure was silent for a moment. Then he spoke in a clear, crisp voice. Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination. Speak again the ancient oaths and return to men the Shards they once bore. He turned to Dalinar, meeting his eyes. The Knights Radiant must stand again. I cannot comprehend how that can be done, Dalinar said softly. But I will try. Men must face them together, the figure said, stepping up to Dalinar, placing a hand on his shoulder. You cannot squabble as in times past. Hes realized that you, given time, will become your own enemies. That he doesnt need to fight you. Not if he can make you forget, make you turn against one another. Your legends say that you won. But the truth is that we lost. And we are losing. Who are you? Dalinar asked again, voice softer. I wish I could do more, repeated the figure in gold. You might be able to get him to choose a champion. He is bound by some rules. All of us are. A champion could work well for you, but it is not certain. And without the Dawnshards Well, I have done what I can. It is a terrible, terrible thing to leave you alone. Who are you? Dalinar asked again. And yet, he thought he knew. I am I was  God. The one you call the Almighty, the creator of mankind. The figure closed his eyes. And now I am dead. Odium has killed me. I am sorry.
