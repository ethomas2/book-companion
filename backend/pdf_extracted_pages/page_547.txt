FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO Kaladin, look at this rock, Tien said. It changes colors when you look at it from different sides. Kal looked away from the window, glancing at his brother. Now thirteen years of age, Tien had turned from an eager boy into an eager adolescent. Though hed grown, he was still small for his age, and his mop of black and brown hair still refused all attempts at order. He was squatting beside the lacquered cobwood dinner table, eyes level with the glossy surface, looking at a small, lumpish rock. Kal sat on a stool peeling longroots with a short knife. The brown roots were dirty on the outside and sticky when he sliced into them, so working on them coated his fingers with a thick layer of crem. He finished a root and handed it up to his mother, who washed it off and sliced it into the stew pot. Mother, look at this, Tien said. Late-afternoon sunlight streamed through the leeside window, bathing the table. From this side, the rock sparkles red, but from the other side, its green. Perhaps its magical, Hesina said. Chunk after chunk of longroot plunked into the water, each splash with a slightly different note. I think it must be, Tien said. Or it has a spren. Do spren live in rocks? Spren live in everything, Hesina replied. They cant live in everything , Kal said, dropping a peel into the pail at his feet. He glanced out the window, watching the road that led from the town to the citylords mansion. They do, Hesina said. Spren appear when something changeswhen fear appears, or when it begins to rain. They are the heart of change, and therefore the heart of all things. This longroot, Kal said, holding it up skeptically.
