pair of his soldiers, then pointed at Kaladin. If you leave me alive, Kaladin said, I promise I will tell your superiors that you had nothing to do with this. If you kill me, it will look like you were trying to hide something. Hide something? Gaz said, glancing at the battle on the Tower. A stray arrow clattered across the rocks a short distance from him, shaft breaking. What would we have to hide? Depends. This very well could look like it was your idea from the start. Brightlord Lamaril, you didnt stop me. You could have, but you didnt, and soldiers saw Gaz and you speaking when you saw what I did. If I cant vouch for your ignorance of what I was going to do, then youll look very, very bad. Lamarils soldiers looked to their leader. The lighteyed man scowled. Beat him, he said, but dont kill him. He turned and marched back toward the Alethi reserve lines. The beefy spearmen walked up to Kaladin. They were darkeyed, but they might as well have been Parshendi for all the sympathy they would show him. Kaladin closed his eyes and steeled himself. He couldnt fight them all off. Not and remain with Bridge Four. A spear butt to the gut knocked him to the ground, and he gasped as the soldiers began to kick. One booted foot tore open his belt pouch. His spheres too precious to leave in the barrackscattered across the stones. They had somehow lost their Stormlight, and were now dun, their life run out. The soldiers kept kicking.
