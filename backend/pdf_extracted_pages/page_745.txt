Everyone else I cannot be everyone else ! Dalinar said, more sharply than he intended. If I ignore our code and ethics, what am I, Navani? The other highprinces and lighteyes deserve recrimination for what they do, and I have let them know it. If I abandon my principles, then I become something far worse than they. A hypocrite! She froze. Please, he said, tense with emotion. Just go. Do not taunt me today. She hesitated, then walked away without a word. She would never know how much he wished her to have made one more objection. In his state, he likely would have been unable to argue further. Once the door shut, he let himself sit down in his chair, exhaling. He closed his eyes. Almighty above, he thought. Please. Just let me know what I am to do.
