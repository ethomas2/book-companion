Idoubt that. Well, if she refuses, it only means that Ill be back. He smiled. That would meanhopefullythat we shall meet each other again. So I look forward to it. I as well. And Im sorry again about the misunderstanding. Brightness! Please. Dont take responsibility for my assumptions. She smiled. I should hesitate to take responsibility for you in any manner or regard, Brother Kabsal. But I still feel bad. It will pass, he noted, blue eyes twinkling. But Ill do my best to make you feel well again. Is there anything youre fond of? Other than respecting ardents and drawing amazing pictures, that is? Jam. He cocked his head. I like it, she said, shrugging. You asked what I was fond of. Jam. So it shall be. He withdrew into the dark corridor, fishing in his robe pocket for his sphere to give him light. In moments, he was gone. Why didnt he wait for Jasnah to return himself? Shallan shook her head, then lacquered her other two pictures. She had just finished letting them dry packing them in her satchelwhen she heard footsteps in the hallway again and recognized Jasnahs voice speaking. Shallan hurriedly gathered her things, leaving the letter on the desk, then stepped up to the side of the alcove to wait. Jasnah Kholin entered a moment later, accompanied by a small group of servants. She did not look pleased.
