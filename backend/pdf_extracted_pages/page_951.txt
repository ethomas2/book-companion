All is withdrawn for me. I stand against the one who saved my life. I protect the one who killed my promises. I raise my hand. The storm responds. Tanatanev 1173, 18 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed mother of four in her sixty-second year. Navani pushed her way past the guards, ignoring their protests and the calls of her attending ladies. She forced herself to remain calm. She would remain calm! What she had heard was just rumor. It had to be. Unfortunately, the older she grew, the worse she became at maintaining a brightladys proper tranquility. She hastened her step through Sadeass warcamp. Soldiers raised hands toward her as she passed, either to offer her aid or to demand she halt. She ignored both; theyd never dare lay a finger on her. Being the kings mother gained one a few privileges. The camp was messy and poorly laid out. Pockets of merchants, whores, and workers made their homes in shanties built on the leeward sides of barracks. Drippings of hardened crem hung from most leeward eaves, like trails of wax left to pour over the side of a table. It was a distinct contrast to the neat lines and scrubbed buildings of Dalinars warcamp. He will be fine, she told herself. Hed better be fine! It was a testament to her disordered state that she barely considered constructing a new street pattern for Sadeas in her head. She made her way directly to the staging area, and arrived to find an army that hardly looked as if it had been to battle. Soldiers without any blood on their uniforms, men chatting and laughing, officers walking down lines and dismissing the men squad by squad. That should have relieved her. This didnt look like a force that had just suffered a disaster. Instead, it made her even more anxious.
