What is happening to me? His weakness today seemed the latest, and most potent, argument to fuel what Adolinand, indeed, what many otherssaid about him. He stood atop the hill, looking eastward, toward the Origin. His eyes went that direction so often. Why? What was He froze, noticing a group of Parshendi on a nearby plateau.
