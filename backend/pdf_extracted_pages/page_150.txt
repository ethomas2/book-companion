Ten people, with Shardblades alight, standing before a wall of black and white and red. Collected: Jesachev, 1173, 12 seconds pre-death. Subject: one of our own ardents, overheard during his last moments. Kaladin had not been assigned to Bridge Four by chance. Out of all the bridge crews, Bridge Four had the highest casualty rate. That was particularly notable, considering that average bridge crews often lost one-third to one-half of their number on a single run. Kaladin sat outside, back to the barrack wall, a sprinkle of rain falling on him. It wasnt a highstorm. Just an ordinary spring rain. Soft. A timid cousin to the great storms. Syl sat on Kaladins shoulder. Or hovered on it. Whatever. She didnt seem to have any weight. Kaladin sat slumped, chin against his chest, staring at a dip in the stone, which was slowly collecting rainwater. He should have moved inside Bridge Fours barrack. It was cold and unfurnished, but it would keep off the rain. But he justcouldnt care. How long had he been with Bridge Four now? Two weeks? Three? An eternity? Of the twenty-five men who had survived his first bridge deployment, twenty-three were now dead. Two had been moved to other bridge crews because theyd done something to please Gaz, but theyd died there. Only one other man and Kaladin remained. Two out of nearly forty. The bridge crews numbers had been replenished with more unfortunates, and most of those had died too. They had been replaced. Many of those had died. Bridgeleader after bridgeleader had been chosen. It was supposed to be a favored position on a bridge crew, always getting to run in the best places. It didnt matter for Bridge Four.
