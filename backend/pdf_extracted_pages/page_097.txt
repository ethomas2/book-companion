she was most accomplished! Many consider the visual arts the most refined of them all. I brought my portfolio. I would show you what I can do. Jasnah pursed her lips. The visual arts are frivolity. I have weighed the facts, child, and I cannot accept you. Im sorry. Shallans heart sank. Your Majesty, Jasnah said to the king, I would like to go to the Palanaeum.

Of course, the king said. I will take you personally. Thank you for what youve done. When I heard that you had requested entrance He continued to babble at Jasnah, who followed him wordlessly down the hallway, leaving Shallan behind. She clutched her satchel to her chest, lowering the cloth from her mouth. Six months of chasing, for this. She gripped the rag in frustration, squeezing sooty water between her fingers. She wanted to cry. That was what she probably would have done if shed been that same child she had been six months ago. But things had changed. She had changed. If she failed, House Davar would fall. Shallan felt her determination redouble, though she wasnt able to stop a few tears of frustration from squeezing out of the corners of her eyes. She was not going to give up until Jasnah was forced to truss her up in chains and have the authorities drag her away. Her step surprisingly firm, she walked in the direction Jasnah had gone. Six months ago, she had explained a desperate plan to her brothers. She would apprentice herself to Jasnah Kholin, scholar, heretic. Not for the education. Not for the prestige. But in order to learn where she kept her Soulcaster. And then Shallan would steal it.
