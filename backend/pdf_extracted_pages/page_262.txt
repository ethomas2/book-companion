Might I be quite frank? Before, you asked why I was so concerned. It is for the following reason: Hes old , Syl said with awe, flitting around the apothecary. Really old. I didnt know men got this old. You sure hes not decayspren wearing a mans skin? Kaladin smiled as the apothecary shuffled forward with his cane, oblivious of the invisible windspren. His face was as full of chasms as the Shattered Plains themselves, weaving out in a pattern from his deeply recessed eyes. He wore a pair of thick spectacles on the tip of his nose, and was dressed in dark robes. Kaladins father had told him of apothecariesmen who walked the line between herbalists and surgeons. Common people regarded the healing arts with enough superstition that it was easy for an apothecary to cultivate an arcane air. The wooden walls were draped with cloth glyphwards styled in cryptic patterns, and behind the counter were shelves with rows of jars. A full human skeleton hung in the far corner, held together by wires. The windowless room was lit with bundles of garnet spheres hanging from the corners. Despite all that, the place was clean and tidy. It had the familiar scent of antiseptic Kaladin associated with his fathers surgery. Ah, young bridgeman. The short apothecary adjusted his spectacles. He stooped forward, running his fingers through his wispy white beard. Come for a ward against danger, perhaps? Or maybe a young washwoman in the camp has caught your eye? I have a potion which, if slipped into her drink, will make her regard you with favor. Kaladin raised an eyebrow. Syl, however, opened her mouth in an amazed expression. You should give that to Gaz, Kaladin. It would be nice if he liked you more. I doubt thats what its intended for, Kaladin thought with a smile.
