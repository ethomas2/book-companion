Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, sat on the wooden tavern floor, lavis beer slowly soaking through his brown trousers. Grimy, worn, and fraying, his clothing was far different from the simple yet elegantwhites he had worn over five years before when hed assassinated the king of Alethkar. Head bowed, hands in his lap, he carried no weapons. He hadnt summoned his Shardblade in years, and it felt equally long since hed had a bath. He did not complain. If he looked like a wretch, people treated him as a wretch. One did not ask a wretch to assassinate people. So hell do whatever you say? asked one of the mine workers sitting at the table. The mans clothing was little better than Szeths, covered with so much dirt and dust that it was difficult to tell grimy skin from grimy cloth. There were four of them, holding ceramic cups. The room smelled of mud and sweat. The ceiling was low, the windowson the leeward side onlymere slots. The table was precariously held together with several leather straps, as the wood was cracked down the middle. TookSzeths current masterset his cup down on the tables tilted side. It sagged under the weight of his arm. Yeah, he sure will. Hey, kurp, look at me. Szeth looked up. Kurp meant child in the local Bav dialect. Szeth was accustomed to such pejorative labels. Though he was in his thirty-fifth year and his seventh year since being named Truthlesshis peoples large, round eyes, shorter stature, and tendency toward baldness led Easterners to claim they looked like children. Stand up, Took said. Szeth did so. Jump up and down. Szeth complied. Pour Tons beer on your head. Szeth reached for it.
