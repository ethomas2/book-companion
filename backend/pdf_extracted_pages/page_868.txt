He closed his eyes. How can this work? Well find a way. Well be denounced. The warcamps already ignore me, Navani said, and they spread rumors and lies about you. What more can they do to us? Theyll find something. As of yet, the devotaries do not condemn me. Gavilar is dead, Navani said, resting her head back against his chest. I was never unfaithful while he lived, though the Stormfather knows I had ample reason. The devotaries can say what they wish, but The Arguments do not forbid our union. Tradition is not the same as doctrine, and I will not hold myself back for fear of offending. Dalinar took a deep breath, then forced himself to open his arms and pull back. If you had hoped to soothe my worries for the day, then this didnt help. She folded her arms. He could still feel where her safehand had touched him on the back. A tender touch, reserved for a family member. Im not here to soothe you, Dalinar. Quite the opposite. Please. I do need time to think. I wont let you put me away. I wont ignore that this happened. I wont Navani, he gently cut her off, I will not abandon you. I promise. She eyed him, then a wry smile crept onto her face. Very well. But you began something today.  I began it? he asked, amused, elated, confused, worried, and ashamed at the same time. The kiss was yours, Dalinar, she said idly, pulling open the door and entering his antechamber. You seduced me to it. What? Seduced? She glanced back at him. Dalinar, Ive never been more open and honest in my life. I know, Dalinar said, smiling. That was the seductive part. He closed the door softly, then let out a sigh. Blood of my fathers, he thought, why cant these things ever be simple? And yet, in direct contrast with his thoughts, he felt as if the entire world had somehow become more right for having gone wrong.
