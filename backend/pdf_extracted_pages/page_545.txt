She slid the working Soulcaster into her safehand within its sleeve, stepping back as Jasnah opened her eyes and glanced at the robe, which now sat innocently beside the nonfunctional Soulcaster. Shallans breath caught in her throat. Jasnah closed her eyes again, handing the brush toward Shallan. Fifty strokes tonight, Shallan. It has been a fatiguing day. Shallan moved by rote, brushing her mistresss hair while clutching the stolen Soulcaster in her hidden safehand, panicked that Jasnah would notice the swap at any moment. She didnt. Not when she put on her robe. Not when she tucked the broken Soulcaster away in her jewelry case and locked it with a key she wore around her neck as she slept. Shallan walked from the room stunned, in turmoil. Exhausted, sickened, confused. But undiscovered.
