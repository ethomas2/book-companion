Kaladin stepped back, watching Moash fall into his stance after Teft shoved him. It was a resetting exerciseMoash would let Teft knock him backward, then would scramble back and set his feet. Time and time again. The purpose was to train oneself to revert to the stance without thinking. Kaladin normally wouldnt have started resetting exercises until the second or third day. Yet here, Moash was drinking it in after only two hours. There were two othersDrehy and Skarwho were nearly as quick to learn. Kaladin leaned back against the stone wall. Cold water leaked down the rock beside him, and a frillbloom plant hesitantly opened its fanlike fronds beside his head: two wide, orange leaves, with spines on the tips, unfolding like opening fists. Is it their bridgeman training? Kaladin wondered. Or is it their passion? He had given them a chance to fight back. That kind of opportunity changed a man. Watching them stand resolute and capable in stances they had only been just been taught, Kaladin realized something. These mencast off by the army, forced to work themselves near to death, then fed extra food by Kaladins careful planningwere the most fit, training-ready recruits hed ever been given. By seeking to beat them down, Sadeas had prepared them to excel.
