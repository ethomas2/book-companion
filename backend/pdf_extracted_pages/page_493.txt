They lived high atop a place no man could reach, but all could visit. The tower city itself, crafted by the hands of no man. Though The Song of the Last Summer is a fanciful tale of romance from the third century after the Recreance, it is likely a valid reference in this case.

Kaladin watched Bridge Four pass, moving awkwardly, maneuvering the bridge at their sides. Fortunately, there were plenty of handles on the bridges underside, and theyd found how to grip them in the right way. They had to carry it at less steep an angle than hed wanted. That would expose their legs, but may be he could train them to adjust to it as the arrows flew. As it was, their carry was slow, and the bridgemen were so bunched up that if the Parshendi managed to drop a man, the others would stumble over him. Lose just a few men, and the balance would be upset so theyd drop it for certain. This will have to be handled very carefully, Kaladin thought. Syl fluttered along behind the bridge crew as a flurry of nearly translucent leaves. Beyond her, something caught Kaladins eye: a uniformed soldier leading a ragged group of men in a despondent clump. Finally, Kaladin thought. Hed been waiting for another group of recruits. He waved curtly to Rock. The Horneater nodded; hed take over training. It was time for a break anyway. Kaladin jogged up the short incline at the rim of the lumberyard, arriving just as Gaz intercepted the newcomers. What a sorry batch, Gaz said. I thought wed been sent the dregs last time, but this lot Lamaril shrugged. Theyre yours now, Gaz. Split them up how you like.
