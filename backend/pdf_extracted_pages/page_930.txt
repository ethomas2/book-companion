Please. Please let me protect him. Make me strong enough. He felt so weak. Blood loss. He found himself slumping to the side, and with tired hands, he tied off his wound. And then, feeling terribly vacant inside, he lay down beside Tien and pulled the body close. Dont worry, Kaladin whispered. When had he started to cry? Ill bring you home. Ill protect you, Tien. Ill bring you back. He held the body into the evening, long past the end of the battle, clinging to it as it slowly grew cold. Kaladin blinked. He wasnt in that hollow with Tien. He was on the plateau. He could hear men dying in the distance. He hated thinking of that day. He almost wished hed never gone looking for Tien. Then he wouldnt have had to watch. Wouldnt have had to kneel there, powerless, as his brother was slaughtered. It was happening again. Rock, Moash, Teft. They were all going to die. And here he lay, powerless again. He could barely move. He felt so drained . Kaladin, a voice whispered. He blinked. Syl was hovering in front of him. Do you know the Words? All I wanted to do was protect them, he whispered. Thats why Ive come. The Words, Kaladin. Theyre going to die. I cant save them. I Amaram slaughtered his men in front of him. A nameless Shardbearer killed Dallet. A lighteyes killed Tien. No. Kaladin rolled over and forced himself to his feet, wavering on weak legs. No! Bridge Four hadnt set its bridge yet. That surprised him. They were still pushing it across the chasm, the Parshendi crowding up on the other side, eager, their song becoming more frantic. His delusions had seemed like hours, but had passed in just a few heartbeats. NO! Lopens litter was in front of Kaladin. A spear rested amid the drained water bottles and ragged bandages, steel head reflecting sunlight. It whispered to him. It terrified him, and he loved it. When the time comes, I hope youre ready. Because this lot will need you.
