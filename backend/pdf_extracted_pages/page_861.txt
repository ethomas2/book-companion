In the storm I awaken, falling, spinning, grieving. Dated Kakanev, 1173, 13 seconds pre-death. Subject was a city guardsman. How can you be so sure it was him, Dalinar? Navani asked softly. Dalinar shook his head. I just am. That was Nohadon. It had been several hours since the end of the vision. Navani had left her writing table to sit in a more comfortable chair near Dalinar. Renarin sat across from him, accompanying them for proprietys sake. Adolin had left to get the highstorm damage report. The lad had seemed very disturbed by the discovery that the visions were real. But the man you saw never spoke his name, Navani said. It was him, Navani. Dalinar stared toward the wall over Renarins head, looking at the smooth brown Soulcast rock. There was an aura of command about him, the weight of great responsibilities. A regality. It could have been some other king, she said. After all, he discarded your suggestion that he write a book. It just wasnt the time for him to write it yet. So much death He was cast down by some great loss. Stormfather! Nine out of ten people dead in war. Can you imagine such a thing? The Desolations, Navani said. Unite the people. The True Desolation comes. Do you know of any references to the Desolations? Dalinar asked. Not the tales ardents tell. Historical references? Navani held a cup of warmed violet wine in her hand, beads of condensation on the rim of the glass. Yes, but I am the wrong one to ask. Jasnah is the historian.
