Ati was once a kind and generous man, and you saw what became of him. Rayse, on the other hand, was among the most loathsome, crafty, and dangerous individuals I had ever met. Yeah, this was cut, the portly leatherworker said, holding up the straps as Adolin watched. Wouldnt you agree, Yis? The other leatherworker nodded. Yis was a yellow-eyed Iriali, with stark golden hair. Not blond, golden. There was even a metallic sheen to it. He kept it short and wore a cap. Obviously, he didnt want to draw attention to it. Many considered a lock of Iriali hair to be a ward of good luck. His companion, Avaran, was an Alethi darkeyes who wore an apron over his vest. If the two men worked in the traditional way, one would labor on the larger, more robust pieceslike saddleswhile the other specialized in fine detail. A group of apprentices toiled in the background, cutting or sewing hogshide. Sliced, Yis agreed, taking the straps from Avaran. I concur. Well hie me to Damnation, Adolin muttered. You mean Elhokar was actually right ? Adolin, a feminine voice said from behind. You said wed be going on a walk. Thats what were doing, he said, turning to smile. Janala stood with arms folded, wearing a sleek yellow dress of impeccable fashion, buttoning up the sides, cupping around the neck with a stiff collar embroidered with crimson thread. I had imagined, she said, that a walk would involve more walking . Hm, he said. Yes. Well be getting right to that soon. Itll be grand. Lots of prancing, sauntering, and, er Promenading? Yis the leatherworker offered.
