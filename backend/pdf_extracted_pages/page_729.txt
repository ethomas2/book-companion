The infused ruby, encased in a metal enclosure, glowed softly and gave off a comfortable heat. It was convenient, though it felt wrong to Adolin that no fire lay crackling there.

Adolins father sat in one of his large, high-backed chairs, hands laced before him, stoic. The warcamps didnt know of his decision yetbless the Heraldsbut he intended to make the announcement soon. Perhaps at tonights feast. All right, fine, Adolin said. Perhaps I said it. But I didnt mean it. Or at least I didnt mean for it to have this effect on you.
