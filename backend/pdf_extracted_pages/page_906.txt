Adolin turned, pointing to the westtoward the plateau south of the one from which Dalinars army had begun their assault over an hour ago. There, leaping across the wide chasm, was an enormous second army of Parshendi. Dalinar slammed his visor up, fresh air washing across his sweaty face. He stepped forward. Hed anticipated this possibility, but someone should have given warning. Where were the scouts? What was He felt a chill. Shaking, he scrambled toward one of the smooth, bulging formations of rock that were plentiful on the Tower. Father? Adolin said, running after him. Dalinar climbed, seeking the top of the formation, dropping his Shardblade. He crested the rise and stood looking northward over his troops and the Parshendi. Northward, toward Sadeas. Adolin climbed up beside him, gauntleted hand slapping up his visor. Oh no he whispered. Sadeass army was retreating across the chasm to the northern staging plateau. Half of it was across already. The eight groups of bridgemen hed lent Dalinar had pulled back and were gone. Sadeas was abandoning Dalinar and his troops, leaving them surrounded on three sides by Parshendi, alone on the Shattered Plains. And he was taking all of his bridges with him.
