Of course, Elhokar said. It is time we had a Highprince of Information, and he specifically noted the cut girth as something he wanted to look into. He knows youve always said you arent suited to these sorts of things. Blood of my fathers, Dalinar thought, looking out at the center of the island, where a group of lighteyes gathered around Sadeas. Ive just been outmaneuvered. Brilliantly. The Highprince of Information had authority over criminal investigations, particularly those of interest to the Crown. In a way, it was nearly as threatening as a Highprince of War, but it wouldnt seem so to Elhokar. All he saw was that he would finally have someone willing to listen to his paranoid fears. Sadeas was a clever, clever man. Dont look so morose, Uncle, Elhokar said. I had no idea youd want the position, and Sadeas just seemed so excited at the idea. Perhaps hell find nothing at all, and the leather was simply worn out. Youll be vindicated in always telling me that Im not in as much danger as I think I am. Vindicated? Dalinar asked softly, still watching Sadeas. Somehow, I doubt that is likely.
