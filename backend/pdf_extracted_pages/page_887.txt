let myself get back into it now, Ill be too eager. Ill push to attack now. Ill have trouble waiting until the men are ready. Trust me, Teft. Teft studied him. Youre scared of it, lad. What? No. I I can see it, Teft said. And Ive seen it before. Last time you fought for someone, you failed, eh? So now you hesitate to take it up again. Kaladin paused. Yes, he admitted. But it was more than that. When he fought again, he would have to become that man from long ago, the man who had been called Stormblessed. The man with confidence and strength. He wasnt certain he could be that man any longer. That was what scared him. Once he held that spear again, there would be no turning back. Well. Teft rubbed his chin. When the time comes, I hope youre ready. Because this lot will need you. Kaladin nodded and Teft hurried back to the others, giving some kind of explanation to mollify them.
