a sickening crunch, spraying out violet ichor, and the beast toppled to the side. The ground shook, nearly knocking Adolin to his knees. Dalinar tossed aside the now-limp claw, Stormlight from the many cracks steaming above him. Nearby, the king picked himself up off the groundit had been mere seconds since hed fallen. Elhokar stumbled to his feet, looking at the fallen beast. Then he turned to his uncle, the Blackthorn. Dalinar nodded thankfully to Adolin, then gestured sharply toward what passed for the beasts neck. Elhokar nodded, then summoned his Blade and rammed it deeply into the monsters flesh. The creatures uniform green eyes blackened and shriveled, smoke twisting into the air. Adolin walked up to join his father, watching as Elhokar plunged his Blade into the chasmfiends chest. Now that the beast was dead, the Blade could cut its flesh. Violet ichor spurted out, and Elhokar dropped his blade and reached into the wound, questing with Plate-enhanced arms, grabbing something. He ripped free the beasts gemheartthe enormous gemstone that grew within all chasmfiends. It was lumpy and uncut, but it was a pure emerald and as big as a mans head. It was the largest gemheart Adolin had ever seen, and even the small ones were worth a fortune. Elhokar held aloft the grisly prize, golden gloryspren appearing around him, and the soldiers yelled in triumph.
