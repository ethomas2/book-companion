Everyone else was so concerned with looking strong, with proving themselves. Was he really the only one who saw how frivolous that was? Strength for strengths sake? What good was strength unless you did something with it? Alethkar was a light, once, he thought. Thats what Gavilars book claims, thats what the visions are showing me. Nohadon was king of Alethkar, so long ago. In the time before the Heralds left. Dalinar felt as if he could almost see it. The secret. The thing that had made Gavilar so excited in the months before his death. If Dalinar could just stretch a little farther, hed make it out. See the pattern in the lives of men. And finally know.

Adolin stepped into the Gallery of Maps. His father was still there, standing alone. Two members of the Cobalt Guard watched over him from a distance. Roion was nowhere to be seen.

Father? Adolin said, stepping up to him. Hello, Adolin. How was the meeting with Roion? Adolin asked, trying to sound cheerful. Disappointing. Im proving far worse at diplomacy than I once was at war- making. Theres no profit in peace. Thats what everyone says. But we had peace once, and seemed to do just fine. Better, even.

Quoting scripture at me? You? Adolin shrugged, feeling foolish. Well, you see, Malasha is rather religious, and so earlier today I was listening to Wait, Dalinar said. Malasha? Whos that?
