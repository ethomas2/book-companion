I realize that you are probably still angry. That is pleasant to know. Much as your perpetual health, I have come to rely upon your dissatisfaction with me. It is one of the cosmeres great constants, I should think. Ten heartbeats. One. That was how long it took to summon a Shardblade. If Dalinars heart was racing, the time was shorter. If he was relaxed, it took longer. Two. On the battlefield, the passing of those beats could stretch like an eternity. He pulled his helm on as he ran. Three. The chasmfiend slammed an arm down, smashing the bridge filled with attendants and soldiers. People screamed, plunging into the chasm. Dalinar dashed forward on Plate-enhanced legs, following the king. Four. The chasmfiend towered like a mountain of interlocking carapace the color of dark violet ink. Dalinar could see why the Parshendi called these things gods. It had a twisted, arrowhead-like face, with a mouth full of barbed mandibles. While it was vaguely crustacean, this was no bulky, placid chull. It had four wicked foreclaws set into broad shoulders, each claw the size of a horse, and a dozen smaller legs that clutched the side of the plateau. Five. Chitin made a grinding noise against stone as the creature finished pulling itself onto the plateau, snatching a cart-pulling chull with a swift claw. Six. To arms, to arms! Elhokar bellowed ahead of Dalinar. Archers, fire! Seven.
