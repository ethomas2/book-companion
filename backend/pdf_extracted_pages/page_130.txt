What does Brightness Jasnah think of your skill? he asked as he worked. I dont think she cares, Shallan said, grimacing and remembering her conversation with the woman. She doesnt seem terribly appreciative of the visual arts. So I have heard. Its one of her few faults, unfortunately. Another being that little matter of her heresy? Indeed, Kabsal said, smiling. I must admit, I stepped in here expecting indifference, not deference. How did you come to be part of her entourage? Shallan started, realizing for the first time that Brother Kabsal must have assumed her to be one of the Brightlady Kholins attendants. Perhaps a ward. Bother, she said to herself. Hum? It appears Ive inadvertently misled you, Brother Kabsal. Im not associated with Brightness Jasnah. Not yet, anyway. Ive been trying to get her to take me on as a ward. Ah, he said, finishing his lacquering. Im sorry. For what? You did nothing wrong. He blew on the picture, then turned it for her to see. It was perfectly lacquered, without any smears. If you would do me a favor, child? he said, setting the page aside. Anything. He raised an eyebrow at that. Anything reasonable, she corrected. By whose reason? Mine, I guess. Pity, he said, standing. Then I will limit myself. If you would kindly let Brightness Jasnah know that I called upon her? She knows you? What business had a Herdazian ardent with Jasnah, a confirmed atheist? Oh, I wouldnt say that, he replied. Id hope shes heard my name, though, since Ive requested an audience with her several times. Shallan nodded, rising. You want to try to convert her, I presume? She presents a unique challenge. I dont think I could live with myself if I didnt at least try to persuade her. And we wouldnt want you to be unable to live with yourself, Shallan noted, as the alternative harks back to your nasty habit of almost killing ardents. Exactly. Anyway, I think a personal message from you might help where written requests have been ignored.
