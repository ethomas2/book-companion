your son. That bout was exciting! Dalinar hadnt found it particularly excitingAdolins opponent hadnt ever held the upper hand. But that was the best kind of battle. Dalinar didnt buy the arguments about a good fight being a close one. When you won, it was always better to win quickly and with extreme advantage. Dalinar and Sadeas stood in respect as the king descended the stairlike stone outcroppings toward the sandy floor below. Dalinar then turned to Sadeas. I should be leaving. Send me a clerk to detail the plateaus you feel we could try this maneuver on. Next time one of them is up for assault, Ill march my army to your staging area and well leave together. You and the smaller, quicker group can go on ahead, and well catch up once youre in position. Sadeas nodded. Dalinar turned to climb up the steps toward the ramp out. Dalinar, Sadeas called after him. Dalinar looked back at the other highprince. Sadeass scarf fluttered in a gust of wind, his arms folded, the metallic golden embroidery glistening. Send me one of your clerks as well. With a copy of that book of Gavilars. It may amuse me to hear its other stories. Dalinar smiled. I will do so, Sadeas.
