down. He came to a crouch, resting one hand on the stone, a jolt of coldness shooting through him. His remaining Stormlight came out in a single burst, flung from his body in a luminescent smoke ring that crashed against the ground before spreading out, vanishing. He stood up straight. Lopen gaped. Kaladin felt an ache in his legs from hitting, but it was like that of having leaped four or five feet. Like ten crashes of thunder on the mounts, gancho! Lopen exclaimed. That was incredible! Thank you, Kaladin said. He raised a hand to his head, glancing at the rocks scattered about the base of the wall, then looking up at the armor tied securely up above. I told you, Syl said, landing on his shoulder. She sounded triumphant. Lopen, Kaladin said. You think you can get that bundle of armor during the next bridge run? Sure, Lopen said. Nobody will see. They ignore us Herdies, they ignore bridgemen, and they especially ignore cripples. To them, Im so invisible I should be walking through walls. Kaladin nodded. Get it. Hide it. Give it to me right before the final plateau assault. They arent going to like you going into a bridge run armored, gancho, Lopen said. I dont think this will be any different from what you tried before. Well see, Kaladin said. Just do it.
