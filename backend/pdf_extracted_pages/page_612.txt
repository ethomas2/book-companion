Chasm duty, Moash grumbled. Great job, lordling. Shed see us dead from a chasmfiend if the Parshendi arrows dont take us. What are we going to do? asked lean, balding Peet, his voice edged with worry. We get to work, Kaladin said, taking the bandage from Dunny. He walked away, leaving them in a frightened clump. A short time later, Kaladin stood at the edge of the chasm, looking down. The hot light of the noon sun burned the back of his neck and cast his shadow downward into the rift, to join with those below. I could fly, he thought. Step off and fall, wind blowing against me. Fly for a few moments. A few, beautiful moments. He knelt and grabbed the rope ladder, then climbed down into the darkness. The other bridgemen followed in a silent group. Theyd been infected by his mood. Kaladin knew what was happening to him. Step by step, he was turning back into the wretch he had been. Hed always known it was a danger. Hed clung to the bridgemen as a lifeline. But he was letting go now. As he stepped down the rungs, a faint translucent figure of blue and white dropped beside him, sitting on a swinglike seat. Its ropes disappeared a few inches above Syls head. What is wrong with you? she asked softly. Kaladin just kept climbing down. You should be happy. You survived the storms. The other bridgemen were so excited. I itched to fight that soldier, Kaladin whispered. Syl cocked her head. I could have beaten him, Kaladin continued. I probably could have beaten all four of them. Ive always been good with the spear. No, not good. Durk called me amazing. A natural born soldier, an artist with the spear. Maybe you should have fought them, then. I thought you didnt like killing. I hate it, she said, growing more translucent. But Ive helped men kill before. Kaladin froze on the ladder.  What?  Its true, she said. I can remember it, just faintly.
