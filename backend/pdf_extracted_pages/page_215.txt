Let me first assure you that the element is quite safe. I have found a good home for it. I protect its safety like I protect my own skin, you might say. The morning after his decision in the highstorm, Kaladin made certain to arise before the others. He threw off his blanket and strode through the room full of blanketed lumps. He didnt feel excited, but he did feel resolute. Determined to fight again. He began that fight by throwing the door open to the sunlight. Groans and curses sounded behind him as the groggy bridgemen awoke. Kaladin turned toward them, hands on hips. Bridge Four currently had thirty-four members. That number fluctuated, but at least twenty-five were needed to carry the bridge. Anything below that, and the bridge would topple for certain. Sometimes, it did even with more members. Up and organize! Kaladin shouted in his best squadleaders voice. He shocked himself with the authority in it. The men blinked bleary eyes. That means , Kaladin bellowed, out of the barrack and form ranks! Youll do it now, storm you, or Ill haul you out one by one myself! Syl fluttered down and landed on his shoulder, watching curiously. Some of the bridgemen sat up, staring at him, baffled. Others turned over in their blankets, putting their backs to him. Kaladin took a deep breath. So be it. He strode into the room and chose a lean Alethi named Moash. He was a strong man; Kaladin needed an example, and one of the skinnier men like Dunny or Narm wouldnt do. Plus, Moash was one of those whod turned over to go back to sleep. Kaladin grabbed Moash by one arm and heaved, pulling with all his strength. Moash stumbled to his feet. He was a younger man, perhaps near Kaladins age, and had a hawkish face.
