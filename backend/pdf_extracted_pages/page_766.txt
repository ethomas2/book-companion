The old days, he said idly. Id like to see the Blackthorn in battle again. How would we split the gemhearts? Two-thirds to you, Dalinar said. As youve got twice as good a record at winning assaults as I have. Sadeas looked thoughtful. And the Shardblades? If we find a Shardbearer, Adolin and I will take him. You win the Blade. He raised a finger. But I win the Plate. To give to my son, Renarin. The invalid? What would you care? Dalinar said. You already have Plate. Sadeas, this could mean winning the war. If we start to work together, we could bring the others in, prepare for a large-scale assault. Storms! We might not even need that. We two have the largest armies; if we could find a way to catch the Parshendi on a large enough plateau with the bulk of our troopssurrounding them so they couldnt escapewe might be able to damage their forces enough to bring an end to this all. Sadeas mulled it over. Then he shrugged. Very well. Send me details via messenger. But do it later. Ive already missed too much of tonights feast.
