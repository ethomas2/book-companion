Thank you, Kaladin. Thank you.  Ive lost both of you, Lirin said hoarsely, splashing away. Storm it! Both of you. He was crying. Kaladins mother was crying too. She clutched Tien again. Father! Kaladin said, turning, amazed at how confident he felt. Lirin paused, standing in the rain, one foot in a puddle where rainspren clustered. They inched away from him like vertical slugs. In four years, I will bring him home safely, Kaladin said. I promise it by the storms and the Almightys tenth name itself. I will bring him back . I promise.
