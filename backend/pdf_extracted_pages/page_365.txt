I dont know whats wrong. Maybe its your guilt over Gavilars death. That book, the Codes, the visionsmaybe theyre all attempts to find escape, find redemption, something. What you see is not real. Your life now is a rationalization, a way of trying to pretend that whats happening isnt happening. But Ill go to Damnation itself before Ill let you drag the entire house down without speaking my mind on it! He practically shouted those last words.

Dalinar said, his voice cold, his eyes hard. Ive gone through each point youve made a dozen times over. Then maybe you should go over them a few more. I must trust myself. The visions are trying to show me something important. I cannot prove it or explain how I know. But its true. Of course you think that, Adolin said, exasperated. Dont you see? Thats exactly what you would feel. Men are very good at seeing what they want to! Look at the king. He sees a killer in every shadow, and a worn strap becomes a convoluted plot to take his life. Dalinar fell silent again. Sometimes, the simple answers are the right ones, Father! Adolin said. The kings strap just wore out. And youyoure seeing things that arent there. Im sorry. They locked expressions. Adolin didnt look away. He wouldnt look away. Dalinar finally turned from him. Leave me, please. All right. Fine. But I want you to think about this. I want you to Adolin. Go.  Adolin gritted his teeth, but turned and stalked away. It needed to be said, he told himself as he left the gallery. That didnt make him feel any less sick about having to be the one who said it.
