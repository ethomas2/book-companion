SEVEN YEARS AGO I can save her, Kal said, pulling off his shirt. The child was only five. Shed fallen far. I can save her. He was mumbling. A crowd had gathered. It had been two months since Brightlord Wistiows death; they still didnt have a replacement citylord. He had barely seen Laral at all in that time. Kal was only thirteen, but hed been trained well. The first danger was blood loss; the childs leg had broken, a compound fracture, and it was spurting red where bone had split the skin. Kal found his hands trembling as he pressed his fingers against the wound. The broken bone was slick, even the jagged end, wetted by blood. Which arteries had been torn? What are you doing to my daughter? Thick-shouldered Harl pushed through the onlookers. You cremling, you storms leavings! Dont touch Miasal! Dont Harl broke off as several of the other men pulled him back. They knew that Kalwho had been passing by chancewas the girls best hope. Alim had already been sent to fetch Kals father. I can save her, Kal said. Her face was pale, and she didnt move. That head wound, maybe it Cant think about that . One of the lower leg arteries was severed. He used his shirt to tie a tourniquet to stop the blood, but it kept slipping. Fingers still pressed against the cut, he called, Fire! I need fire! Hurry! And someone give me your shirt! Several men rushed off as Kal elevated the leg. One of the men hurriedly handed over his shirt. Kal knew where to pinch to cut off the artery; the tourniquet slipped, but his fingers did not. He held that artery closed, pressing the shirt on the rest of the wound until Valama came back with a candles flame.
