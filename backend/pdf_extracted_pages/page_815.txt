Bridge Four was making their evening stew, chatting and laughing. The nearly twenty wounded men from other crews sat eating gratefully. It was gratifying, how quickly they had lost their hollow-eyed expressions and begun laughing with the other men. The smell of spicy Horneater stew was thick in the air. Kaladin slowed his jog, coming to a stop beside the bridgemen. Several looked concerned as they saw him, panting and sweating. Syl landed on his shoulder. Kaladin sought out Teft. The aging bridgeman sat alone below the barracks eaves, staring down at the rock in front of him. He hadnt noticed Kaladin yet. Kaladin gestured for the others to continue, then walked over to Teft. He squatted down before the man. Teft looked up in surprise. Kaladin? What do you know? Kaladin said quietly, intense. And how do you know it? I Teft said. When I was a youth, my family belonged to a secret sect that awaited the return of the Radiants. I quit when I was just a youth. I thought it was nonsense. He was holding things back; Kaladin could tell from the hesitation in his voice. Responsibility. How much do you know about what I can do? Not much, Teft said. Just legends and stories. Nobody really knows what the Radiants could do, lad. Kaladin met his eyes, then smiled. Well, were going to find out.
