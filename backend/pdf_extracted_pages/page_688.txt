would be returning to your family. What? When? When he met me in the hallway outside, she said, and finally gave me permission to visit you. You make it sound as if you were waiting out there. Jasnah didnt reply. But your research! Can be done in the hospital waiting chamber. She hesitated. It has been somewhat difficult for me to focus these last few days. Jasnah! Thats quite nearly human of you! Jasnah regarded her reprovingly, and Shallan winced, immediately regretting the words. Im sorry. Ive learned poorly, havent I? Or perhaps you are just practicing the art of the apology. So that you will not be unsettled when the need arises, as I am. How very clever of me. Indeed. Can I stop now, then? Shallan asked. I think Ive had quite enough practice. I should think, Jasnah said, that apology is an art of which we could use a few more masters. Do not use me as a model in this. Pride is often mistaken for faultlessness. She leaned forward. I am sorry, Shallan Davar. In overworking you, I may have done the world a disservice and stolen from it one of the great scholars of the rising generation. Shallan blushed, feeling more foolish and guilty. Shallans eyes flickered to her mistresss hand. Jasnah wore the black glove that hid the fake. In the fingers of her safehand, Shallan grasped the pouch holding the Soulcaster. If Jasnah only knew. Jasnah took the book from beneath her arm and set it on the bed beside Shallan. This is for you. Shallan picked it up. She opened to the front page, but it was blank. The next one was as well, as were all inside of it. Her frown deepened, and she looked up at Jasnah. Its called the Book of Endless Pages , Jasnah said. Er, Im pretty sure its not endless, Brightness. She flipped to the last page and held it up. Jasnah smiled. Its a metaphor, Shallan. Many years ago, someone dear to me made a very good attempt at converting me to Vorinism. This was the method he used. Shallan cocked her head.
