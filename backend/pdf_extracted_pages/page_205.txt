Storms take that animal. I swear, the man who trained it must have been daft. He was looking across at the next plateau. Adolin followed his glance. The crablike chull that had been towing the bait was lumbering away from the chasm with a slow, yet determined gait. Its handlers were yelling, running after it. Im sorry, Brightlord, Bashin said. Its been doing this all day. The chull bleated in a gravelly voice. Something seemed wrong to Adolin. We can send for another one, Elhokar said. It shouldnt take too long to  Bashin? Dalinar said, his voice suddenly alarmed. Shouldnt there be bait on the end of that beasts rope? The huntmaster froze. The rope the chull was towing was frayed at the end. Something darksomething mind-numbingly enormousrose out of the chasm on thick, chitinous legs. It climbed onto the plateaunot the small plateau where the hunt was supposed to take place, but the viewing plateau where Dalinar and Adolin stood. The plateau filled with attendants, unarmed guests, female scribes, and unprepared soldiers. Aw, Damnation, Bashin said.
