ONE YEAR AGO Kaladin sat quietly in the waiting room of Amarams wooden warcenter. It was constructed of a dozen study sections that could be disconnected and pulled by chulls. Kaladin sat beside a window, looking out at the camp. There was a hole where Kaladins squad had been housed. He could make it out from where he sat. Their tents had been broken down and given to other squads. Four of his men remained. Four, out of twenty-six. And men called him lucky. Men called him Stormblessed. Hed begun to believe that. I killed a Shardbearer today , he thought, mind numb. Like Lanacin the Surefooted, or Evod Markmaker. Me. I killed one. And he didnt care. He crossed his arms on the wooden windowsill. There was no glass in the window and he could feel the breeze. A windspren flitted from one tent to another. Behind Kaladin, the room had a thick red rug and shields on the walls. There were a number of padded wooden chairs, like the one Kaladin sat in. This was the small waiting chamber of the warcentersmall, yet larger than his entire house back in Hearthstone, the surgery included. I killed a Shardbearer, he thought again. And then I gave away the Blade and Plate . That single event had to be the most monumentally stupid thing anyone, in any kingdom, in any era, had ever done. As a Shardbearer, Kaladin would have been more important than Roshonemore important than Amaram. Hed have been able to go to the Shattered Plains and fight in a real war. No more squabbling over borders. No more petty lighteyed captains belonging to unimportant families, bitter because theyd been left behind. He would never again have had to worry about blisters from boots that didnt fit, dinner slop that tasted of crem, or other soldiers who wanted to pick a fight.
