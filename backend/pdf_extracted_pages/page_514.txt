And would you not rather be a sense of euphoria? Bringing pleasant feelings and joy to those you infect? Euphoria passes. It is usually brief, so we spend more time longing for it than enjoying it. She sighed. Look what weve done. Now Im depressed. At least turning back to my studies will seem exciting by comparison. He frowned at the books. I was under the impression that you enjoyed your studies. As was I. Then Jasnah Kholin stomped into my life and proved that even something pleasant could become boring. I see. So shes a harsh mistress? Actually, no, Shallan said. Im just fond of hyperbole. Im not, he said. Its a real bastard to spell. Kabsal! Sorry, he said. Then he glanced upward. Sorry. Im sure the ceiling forgives you. To get the Almightys attention, you might want to burn a prayer instead. I owe him a few anyway, Kabsal said. You were saying? Well, Brightness Jasnah isnt a harsh mistress. Shes actually everything shes said to be. Brilliant, beautiful, mysterious. Im fortunate to be her ward. Kabsal nodded. She is said to be a sterling woman, save for one thing. You mean the heresy? He nodded. Its not as bad for me as you think, she said. Shes rarely vocal about her beliefs unless provoked. Shes ashamed, then. I doubt that. Merely considerate. He eyed her. You neednt worry about me, Shallan said. Jasnah doesnt try to persuade me to abandon the devotaries. Kabsal leaned forward, growing more somber. He was older than shea man in his mid-twenties, confident, self-assured, and earnest. He was practically the only man near her age that shed ever talked to outside of her fathers careful supervision. But he was also an ardent. So, of course, nothing could come of it. Could it? Shallan, Kabsal said gently, can you not see how wehow Iwould be concerned? Brightness Jasnah is a very powerful and intriguing woman. We would expect her ideas to be infectious. Infectious? I thought you said I was the disease. I never said that!
