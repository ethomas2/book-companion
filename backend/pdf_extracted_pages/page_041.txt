Youve killed me. Bastards, youve killed me! While the sun is still hot, I die! Collected on the fifth day of the week Chach of the month Betab of the year 1171, ten seconds before death. Subject was a darkeyed soldier thirty- one years of age. Sample is considered questionable. FIVE YEARS LATER Im going to die, arent I? Cenn asked. The weathered veteran beside Cenn turned and inspected him. The veteran wore a full beard, cut short. At the sides, the black hairs were starting to give way to grey. Im going to die, Cenn thought, clutching his spearthe shaft slick with sweat. Im going to die. Oh, Stormfather. Im going to die. How old are you, son? the veteran asked. Cenn didnt remember the mans name. It was hard to recall anything while watching that other army form lines across the rocky battlefield. That lining up seemed so civil. Neat, organized. Shortspears in the front ranks, longspears and javelins next, archers at the sides. The darkeyed spearmen wore equipment like Cenns: leather jerkin and knee- length skirt with a simple steel cap and a matching breastplate. Many of the lighteyes had full suits of armor. They sat astride horses, their honor guards clustering around them with breastplates that gleamed burgundy and deep forest green. Were there Shardbearers among them? Brightlord Amaram wasnt a Shardbearer. Were any of his men? What if Cenn had to fight one? Ordinary men didnt kill Shardbearers. It had happened so infrequently that each occurrence was now legendary. Its really happening, he thought with mounting terror. This wasnt a drill in the camp. This wasnt training out in the fields, swinging sticks. This was real .
