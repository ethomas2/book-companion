Radiant / of birthplace / the announcer comes / to come announce / the birthplace of Radiants.

Many chasmfiends lived in that area, and Alethi scouts patrolled the perimeter beyond. If Kaladins team met them, they would have trouble explaining what a group of armed menmany with slave brandswas doing there. Syl walked along the wall of the chasm, about level with Kaladins head.
