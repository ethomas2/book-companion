Within a heartbeat, Alezarv was there, crossing a distance that would have taken more than four months to travel by foot. Another folktale, this one recorded in Among the Darkeyed, by Calinam. Page 102. Stories of instantaneous travel and the Oathgates pervade these tales. Shallans hand flew across the drawing board, moving as if of its own accord, charcoal scratching, sketching, smudging. Thick lines first, like trails of blood left by a thumb drawn across rough granite. Tiny lines like scratches made by a pin. She sat in her closetlike stone chamber in the Conclave. No windows, no ornamentation on the granite walls. Just the bed, her trunk, the nightstand, and the small desk that doubled as a drawing table. A single ruby broam cast a bloody light on her sketch. Usually, to produce a vibrant drawing, she had to consciously memorize a scene. A blink, freezing the world, imprinting it into her mind. She hadnt done that during Jasnahs annihilation of the thieves. Shed been too frozen by horror or morbid fascination. Despite that, she could see each of those scenes in her mind just as vividly as if shed deliberately memorized them. And these memories didnt vanish when she drew them. She couldnt rid her mind of them. Those deaths were burned into her. She sat back from her drawing board, hand shaking, the picture before her an exact charcoal representation of the suffocating nightscape, squeezed between alley walls, a tortured figure of flame rising toward the sky. At that moment, its face still held its shape, shadow eyes wide and burning lips agape. Jasnahs hand was toward the figure, as if warding, or worshipping.
