Death upon the lips. Sound upon the air. Char upon the skin. From The Last Desolation by Ambrian, line 335. Kaladin stumbled into the light, shading his eyes against the burning sun, his bare feet feeling the transition from cold indoor stone to sun-warmed stone outside. The air was lightly humid, not muggy as it had been in previous weeks. He rested his hand on the wooden doorframe, his legs quivering rebelliously, his arms feeling as if hed carried a bridge for three days straight. He breathed deeply. His side should have blazed with pain, but he felt only a residual soreness. Some of his deeper cuts were still scabbed over, but the smaller ones had vanished completely. His head was surprisingly clear. He didnt even have a headache. He rounded the side of the barrack, feeling stronger with each step, though he kept his hand on the wall. Lopen followed behind; the Herdazian had been watching over Kaladin when he awoke. I should be dead, Kaladin thought. What is going on? On the other side of the barrack he was surprised to find the men carrying their bridge in daily practice. Rock ran at the front center, giving the marching beat as Kaladin had once done. They reached the other side of the lumberyard and turned around, charging back. Only when they were almost past the barrack did one of the men in frontMoashnotice Kaladin. He froze, nearly causing the entire bridge crew to trip. What is wrong with you? Torfin yelled from behind, head enveloped by the wood of the bridge. Moash didnt listen. He ducked out from under the bridge, looking at Kaladin with wide eyes. Rock gave a hasty shout for the men to put down the bridge. More saw him, adopting the same reverent expressions as Moash.
