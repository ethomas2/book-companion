He must pick it up, the fallen title! The tower, the crown, and the spear! Dated Vevahach, 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. Subject: a prostitute. Back ground unknown. A razor-edged arrow snapped into the wood next to Kaladins face. He could feel warm blood seep from a gash on his cheek, creeping down his face, mixing with the sweat dripping from his chin. Stay firm! he bellowed, charging over the uneven ground, the bridges familiar weight on his shoulders. Nearbyjust ahead and to the leftBridge Twenty floundered, four men at the front falling to arrows, their corpses tripping up those behind. The Parshendi archers knelt on the other side of the chasm, singing calmly despite the hail of arrows from Sadeass side. Their black eyes were like shards of obsidian. No whites. Just that emotionless black. In those momentslistening to men scream, cry, yell, howlKaladin hated the Parshendi as much as he hated Sadeas and Amaram. How could they sing while they killed? The Parshendi in front of Kaladins crew pulled and aimed. Kaladin screamed at them, feeling a strange surge of strength as the arrows were loosed. The shafts zipped through the air in a focused wave. Ten shafts struck the wood near Kaladins head, their force throwing a shudder through it, chips of wood splintering free. But not a one struck flesh. Across the chasm, several of the Parshendi lowered their bows, breaking off their chanting. Their demonic faces bore looks of stupefaction. Down! Kaladin yelled as the bridge crew reached the chasm. The ground was rough here, covered in bulbous rockbuds. Kaladin stepped on the vine from one of them, causing the plant to retract. The bridgemen heaved the bridge up and off their shoulders, then expertly stepped aside, lowering it to the ground.
