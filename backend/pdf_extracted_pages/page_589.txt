FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO Kaladin pushed past the shrieking Laral and stumbled into the surgery room. Even after years working with his father, the amount of blood in the room was shocking. It was as if someone had dumped out a bucket of bright red paint. The scent of burned flesh hung in the air. Lirin worked frantically on Brightlord Rillir, Roshones son. An evil-looking, tusklike thing jutted from the young mans abdomen, and his lower right leg was crushed. It hung by only a few tendons, splinters of bone poking out like reeds from the waters of a pond. Brightlord Roshone himself lay on the side table, groaning, eyes squeezed shut as he held his leg, which was pierced by another of the bony spears. Blood leaked from his improvised bandage, flowed down the side of the table, and dripped to the floor to mix with his sons. Kaladin stood in the doorway gaping. Laral continued to scream. She clutched the doorframe as several of Roshones guards tried to pull her away. Her wails were frantic. Do something! Work harder! He cant! He was where it happened and I dont care and let me go! The garbled phrases degenerated into screeches. The guards finally got her away. Kaladin! his father snapped. I need you! Shocked into motion, Kaladin entered the room, scrubbing his hands then gathering bandages from the cabinet, stepping in blood. He caught a glimpse of Rillirs face; much of the skin on the right side had been scraped off. The eyelid was gone, the blue eye itself sliced open at the front, deflated like the skin of a grape pressed for wine. Kaladin hastened to his father with the bandages. His mother appeared at the doorway a moment later, Tien behind her. She raised a hand to her mouth, then pulled Tien away. He stumbled, looking woozy. She returned in a moment without him.
