helped the wounded or not. Death isnt better, Kaladin said, looking Teft in the eyes. Oh, its easy to say that now. But when you stand on the ledge and look down into that dark, endless pit, you change your mind. Just like Hobber did. Just like Ive done. He hesitated, seeing something in the older mans eyes. I think youve seen it too. Aye, Teft said softly. Aye, I have. So, are you with us in this thing? Rock said, squatting down. Us? Kaladin thought, smiling faintly. Teft looked back and forth between the two of them. I get to keep my food? Yes, Kaladin said. Teft shrugged. All right then, I guess. Cant be any harder than sitting here and having a staring contest with mortality. Kaladin held out a hand. Teft hesitated, then took it. Rock held out a hand. Rock. Teft looked at him, finished shaking Kaladins hand, then took Rocks. Im Teft. Stormfather, Kaladin thought. Id forgotten that most of them dont even bother to learn each others names. What kind of name is Rock? Teft asked, releasing the hand. Is a stupid one, Rock said with an even face. But at least it has meaning. Does your name mean anything? I guess not, Teft said, rubbing his bearded chin. Rock, this is not my real name, the Horneater admitted. Is just what lowlanders can pronounce. Whats your real name, then? Teft asked. You wont be able to say it. Teft raised an eyebrow. Numuhukumakiakiaialunamor, Rock said. Teft hesitated, then smiled. Well, I guess in that case, Rock will do just fine. Rock laughed, settling down. Our bridgeleader has a plan. Something glorious and daring. Has something to do with spending our afternoon moving stones in the heat. Kaladin smiled, leaning forward. We need to gather a certain kind of plant. A reed that grows in small patches outside the camp.
