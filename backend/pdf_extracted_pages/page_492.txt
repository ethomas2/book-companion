spend them anyway. Kals father snorted. He ducked into the room. Kal cried out, moving back as Lirin threw open the cabinet where he kept the spheres. He grabbed the large glass goblet that he stored them in; it was covered with a black cloth. You want them? Lirin called, walking to the doorway, passing Kal. Father? Kal said, panicked. You want the light for yourself? Lirins voice grew louder. Here! He pulled the cloth free. The goblet exploded with fiery radiance, the brightness nearly blinding. Kal raised his arm. His father was a shadowed silhouette that seemed to hold the sun itself in its fingers. The large goblet shone with a calm light. Almost a cold light. Kal blinked away tears, his eyes adjusting. He could see the men outside clearly now. Where dangerous shadows had once loomed, cringing men now raised hands. They didnt seem so intimidating; in fact, the cloths over their faces looked ridiculous. Where Kal had been afraid, he now felt strangely confident. For a moment, it wasnt light his father held, but understanding itself. Thats Luten, Kal thought, noticing a man who limped. It was easy to distinguish him, despite the mask. Kals father had operated on that leg; it was because of him that Luten could still walk. He recognized others too. Horl was the one with the wide shoulders, Balsas the man wearing the nice new coat. Lirin didnt say anything to them at first. He stood with that light blazing, illuminating the entire stone square outside. The men seemed to shrink down, as if they knew he recognized them. Well? Lirin said. Youve threatened violence against me. Come. Hit me. Rob me. Do it knowing Ive lived among you almost my entire life. Do it knowing that Ive healed your children. Come in. Bleed one of your own! The men faded into the night without a word.
