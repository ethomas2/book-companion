the mans gaze. Teft, the man finally said. My names Teft. That wasnt so hard, Kaladin said, holding out his hand. Im Kaladin. Your bridgeleader. The man hesitated, then took Kaladins hand, wrinkling his brow in confusion. Kaladin vaguely remembered the man. Hed been in the crew for a while, a few weeks at least. Before that, hed been on another bridge crew. One of the punishments for bridgemen who committed camp infractions was a transfer to Bridge Four. Get some rest, Kaladin said, releasing Tefts hand. Were going to have a hard day tomorrow. How do you know? Teft asked, rubbing his bearded chin. Because were bridgemen, Kaladin said, standing.  Every day is hard. Teft hesitated, then smiled faintly. Kelek knows thats true. Kaladin left him, moving down the line of huddled figures. He visited each man, prodding or threatening until the man gave his name. They each resisted. It was as if their names were the last things they owned, and wouldnt be given up cheaply, though they seemed surprisedperhaps even encouragedthat someone cared to ask. He clutched to these names, repeating each one in his head, holding them like precious gemstones. The names mattered. The men mattered. Perhaps Kaladin would die in the next bridge run, or perhaps he would break under the strain, and give Amaram one final victory. But as he settled down on the ground to plan, he felt that tiny warmth burning steadily within him. It was the warmth of decisions made and purpose seized. It was responsibility. Syl alighted on his leg as he sat, whispering the names of the men to himself. She looked encouraged. Bright. Happy. He didnt feel any of that. He felt grim, tired, and wet. But he wrapped himself in the responsibility he had taken, the responsibility for these men. He held to it like a climber clung to his last handhold as he dangled from a cliffside. He would find a way to protect them. THE END OF Part One
