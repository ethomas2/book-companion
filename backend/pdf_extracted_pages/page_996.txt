Shallan rubbed her eyes. Shed read through Jasnahs notesat least the most important ones. Those alone had made a large stack. She still sat in the alcove, though theyd sent a parshman to get her a blanket to wrap around herself, covering up the hospital robe. Her eyes burned from the night spent crying, then reading. She was exhausted. And yet she also felt alive. Its true, she said. Youre right. The Voidbringers are the parshmen. I can see no other conclusion. Jasnah smiled, looking oddly pleased with herself, considering that shed only convinced one person. So what next? Shallan asked. That has to do with your previous studies. My studies? You mean your fathers death? Indeed. The Parshendi attacked him, Shallan said. Killed him suddenly, without warning. She focused on the other woman. Thats what made you begin studying all of this, isnt it? Jasnah nodded. Those wild parshmenthe Parshendi of the Shattered Plainsare the key. She leaned forward. Shallan. The disaster awaiting us is all too real, all too terrible. I dont need mystical warnings or theological sermons to frighten me. Im downright terrified in my own right. But we have the parshmen tamed. Do we? Shallan, think of what they do, how theyre regarded, how often theyre used. Shallan hesitated. The parshmen were pervasive. They serve our food, Jasnah continued. They work our storehouses. They tend our children . There isnt a village in Roshar that doesnt have some parshmen. We ignore them; we just expect them to be there, doing as they do. Working without complaint.
