frustrated. Nan Balat had asked Luesh how the devices worked, and hed said that it was easier to show than explain. Hed promised to give them answers if she actually managed to steal Jasnahs. Now he was dead. Was she doomed to carry this one back to her family, only to immediately give it away to those dangerous men, never using it to gain wealth to protect her house? All because they didnt know how to activate it? The other fabrials shed used had been simple to activate, but those were constructed by contemporary artifabrians. Soulcasters were fabrials from ancient times. They wouldnt employ modern methods of activation. She stared at the glowing gemstones suspended on the back of her hand. How would she figure out the method of using a tool thousands of years old, one forbidden to any but ardents? She slid the Soulcaster back into her safepouch. It seemed she was back to searching the Palanaeum. That or asking Kabsal. But would she manage that without looking suspicious? She broke out his bread and jam, eating and thinking idly. If Kabsal didnt know, and if she couldnt find the answers by the time she left Kharbranth, were there other options? If she took the artifact to the Veden kingor maybe the ardentsmight they be able to protect her family in exchange for the gift? After all, she couldnt really be blamed for stealing from a heretic, and so long as Jasnah didnt know who had the Soulcaster, they would be safe. For some reason, that made her feel even worse. Stealing the Soulcaster to save her family was one thing, but turning it over to the very ardents whom Jasnah disdained? It seemed a greater betrayal. Yet another difficult decision. Well then, she thought, its a good thing Jasnah is so determined to train me in how to deal with those. By the time all this is done, I should be quite the expert.
