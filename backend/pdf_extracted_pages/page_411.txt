brownish liquid. Will you join us? Kaladin asked. Please. Skar looked at him, then back down at the stew. He laughed, taking the stew. Id join the Nightwatcher herself around a fire if there was stew involved! Be careful, Teft said. Thats Horneater stew. Might be snail shells or crab claws floating in it. There is not! Rock barked. Is unfortunate that you have unrefined lowlander tastes, but I prepare the food such as I am ordered by our dear bridgeleader. Kaladin smiled, letting out a deep breath as Skar sat down. Others trailed out after him, taking bowls, sitting. Some stared into the fire, not saying much, but others began to laugh and sing. At one point, Gaz walked past, eyeing them with his single eye, as if trying to decide if they were breaking any camp regulations. They werent. Kaladin had checked. Kaladin dipped out a bowl of stew and held it toward Gaz. The bridge sergeant snorted in derision and stalked away. Cant expect too many miracles in one night, Kaladin thought with a sigh, settling back down and trying the stew. It was quite good. He smiled, joining in the next verse of Dunnys song. The next morning, when Kaladin called for the bridgemen to rise, three-quarters of them piled out of the barrackeveryone but the loudest complainers: Moash, Sigzil, Narm, and a couple of others. The ones who came to his call looked surprisingly refreshed, despite the long evening spent singing and eating. When he ordered them to join him in practice carrying the bridge, almost all of those who had risen joined him. Not everyone, but enough. He had a feeling that Moash and the others would give in before too long. Theyd eaten his stew. Nobody had turned that down. And now that he had so many, the others would feel foolish not joining in. Bridge Four was his. Now he had to keep them alive long enough for that to mean something.
