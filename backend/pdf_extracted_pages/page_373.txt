Kals shock; a few of them began whispering in anxiety. Brightlord Roshone! Kals father called. The crowd hushed. The lighteyed man glanced back. People shied away, and Kal found himself shrinking down beneath that harsh gaze. Who spoke? Roshone demanded, his voice a low baritone. Lirin stepped forward, raising a hand. Brightlord. Was your trip pleasant? Please, can we show you the town? What is your name? Lirin, Brightlord. Hearthstones surgeon. Ah, Roshone said. Youre the one who let old Wistiow die. The brightlords expression darkened. In a way, its your fault Im in this pitiful, miserable quarter of the kingdom. He grunted, then climbed back in the carriage and slammed the door. Within seconds, the carriage driver had replaced the stairs, climbed into his place, and started turning the vehicle around. Kals father slowly let his arm fall to his side. The townspeople began to chatter immediately, gossiping about the soldiers, the carriage, the horses. Kal sat down on his barrel. Well, he thought. I guess we could expect a warrior to be curt, right? The heroes from the legends werent necessarily the polite types. Killing people and fancy talking didnt always go together, old Jarel had once told him. Lirin walked back, his expression troubled. Well? Hesina said, trying to sound cheerful. What do you think? Did we throw the queen or the tower? Neither. Oh? And what did we throw instead? Im not sure, he said, glancing over his shoulder. A pair and a trio, maybe. Lets get back home. Tien scratched his head in confusion, but the words weighed on Kal. The tower was three pairs in a game of breakneck. The queen was two trios. The first was an outright loss, the other an outright win. But a pair and a trio, that was called the butcher. Whether you won or not would depend on the other throws you made. And, more importantly, on the throws of everyone else.
