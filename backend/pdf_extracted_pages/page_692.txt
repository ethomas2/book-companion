only the white robe. He was shaking. Andand And so was she. The room was spinning. Suddenly she felt very, very tired. She tried to stand, but slipped, dizzy. She barely felt herself hit the floor. Someone was kneeling above her, cursing. Jasnah. Her voice was distant. Shes been poisoned. I need a garnet. Bring me a garnet! Theres one in my pouch, Shallan thought. She fumbled with it, managing to undo the tie of her safehands sleeve. Whywhy does she want But no, I cant show her that. The Soulcaster! Her mind was so fuzzy. Shallan, Jasnahs voice said, anxious, very soft. Im going to have to Soulcast your blood to purify it. It will be dangerous. Extremely dangerous. Im not good with flesh or blood. Its not where my talent lies. She needs it. To save me. Weakly, she reached in and pulled out her safepouch with her right hand. Youcant Hush, child. Where is that garnet! You cant Soulcast, Shallan said weakly, pulling the ties of her pouch open. She upended it, vaguely seeing a fuzzy golden object slip out onto the floor, alongside the garnet that Kabsal had given her. Stormfather! Why was the room spinning so much? Jasnah gasped. Distantly. Fading Something happened. A flash of warmth burned through Shallan, something inside her skin, as if she had been dumped into a steaming hot cauldron. She screamed, arching her back, her muscles spasming. All went black.
