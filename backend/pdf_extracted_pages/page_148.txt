this, reading through each notation. Why have you made these sketches? Jasnah asked at the end. Why, Brightness? Well, because I wanted to. She grimaced. Should she have said something profound instead? Jasnah nodded slowly. Then she rose. I have rooms in the Conclave, granted to me by the king. Gather your things and go there. You look exhausted. Brightness? Shallan asked, rising, a thrill of excitement running through her. Jasnah hesitated at the doorway. At first meeting, I took you for a rural opportunist, seeking only to ride my name to greater wealth. Youve changed your mind? No, Jasnah said, there is undoubtedly some of that in you. But we are each many different people, and you can tell much about a person by what they carry with them. If that notebook is any indication, you pursue scholarship in your free time for its own sake. That is encouraging. It is, perhaps, the best argument you could make on your own behalf. If I cannot be rid of you, then I might as well make use of you. Go and sleep. Tomorrow we will begin early, and you will divide your time between your education and helping me with my studies. With that, Jasnah withdrew. Shallan sat, bemused, blinking tired eyes. She got out a sheet of paper and wrote a quick prayer of thanks, which shed burn later. Then she hurriedly gathered up her books and went looking for a servant to send to the Winds Pleasure for her trunk. It had been a very, very long day. But shed won. The first step had been completed. Now her real task began.
