beneath her. She zipped down to hover before him, changing from a leaf to a young woman standing in the air. Yes? Kaladin glanced around. Come with me, he said, hurrying to one of the alleys between barracks. He pressed himself up against a wall, standing in the shade, breathing in and out. Nobody could see him here. Syl alighted in the air before him, hands behind her back, looking closely at him. Youre glowing. What have you done to me? She cocked her head, then shrugged. Syl he said threateningly, though he wasnt certain what harm he could do a spren. I dont know, Kaladin, she said frankly, sitting down, her legs hanging over the side of the invisible platform. I canI can only faintly remember things I used to know so well. This world, interacting with men. But you did do something.  We have done something. It wasnt me. It wasnt you. But together She shrugged again. That isnt very helpful. She grimaced. I know. Im sorry. Kaladin raised a hand. In the shade, the light streaming off of him was more obvious. If someone walked byHow do I get rid of it? Why do you want to get rid of it? Well, becauseIBecause. Syl didnt respond. Something occurred to Kaladin. Something, perhaps, he should have asked long ago. Youre not a windspren, are you? She hesitated, then shook her head. No. What are you, then? I dont know. I bind things. Bind things. When she played pranks, she made items stick together. Shoes stuck to the ground and made men trip. People reached for their jackets hanging on hooks and couldnt pull them free. Kaladin reached down, picking a stone up off the ground. It was as big as his palm, weathered smooth by highstorm winds and rain. He pressed it against the wall of the barrack and willed his Light into the stone. He felt a chill. The rock began to stream with luminescent vapors. When Kaladin pulled his hand away, the stone remained where it was, clinging to the side of the building.
