ragged, sacklike length of cloth wrapping his waist. He stood with head bowed, wet, ratty hair hanging down over his face and mixing with a beard that had bits of wood and leaves stuck in it. His muscles glistened, wet as if hed just swum a great distance. To his side, he carried a massive Shardblade, point down, sticking about a fingers width into the stone, his hand on the hilt. The Blade reflected torchlight; it was long, narrow, and straight, shaped like an enormous spike. Welcome, lost one, Wit whispered. Who are you! one of the guards called, nervous, as one of the other two ran to give the alert. A Shardbearer had come to Kholinar. The figure ignored the question. He stepped forward, dragging his Shardblade, as if it weighed a great deal. It cut the rock behind him, leaving a tiny groove in the stone. The figure walked unsteadily, and nearly tripped. He steadied himself against the gate door, and a lock of hair moved from the side of his face, exposing his eyes. Dark brown eyes, like a man of the lower class. Those eyes were wild, dazed. The man finally noticed the two guards, who stood, terrified, with spears leveled at him. He raised his empty hand toward them. Go, he said raggedly, speaking perfect Alethi, no hint of an accent. Run! Raise the call! Give the warning! Who are you? one of the guards forced out. What warning? Who attacks? The man paused. He raised a hand to his head, wavering. Who am I? I I am TalenelElin, Stonesinew, Herald of the Almighty. The Desolation has come. Oh, God it has come. And I have failed. He slumped forward, hitting the rocky ground, Shardblade clattering down behind him. It did not vanish. The guards inched forward. One prodded the man with the butt of his spear. The man who had named himself a Herald did not move. What is it we value? Wit whispered. Innovation. Originality. Novelty. But most importantly timeliness. I fear you may be too late, my confused, unfortunate friend. THE END OF Book One of THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE
