Amaram looked guilty suddenly, as if he knew what Kaladin had said was true. He turned away, waving to the stormwarden. The man turned from the brazier, holding something hed been heating in the coals. A small branding iron. Its all an act? Kaladin asked. The honorable brightlord who cares about his men? Lies? All of it? This is for my men, Amaram said. He took the Shardblade from the cloth, holding it in his hand. The gemstone at its pommel let out a flash of white light. You cant begin to understand the weights I carry, spearman. Amarams voice lost some of its calm tone of reason. He sounded defensive. I cant worry about the lives of a few darkeyed spearmen when thousands of people may be saved by my decision. The stormwarden stepped up to Kaladin, positioning the branding iron. The glyphs, reversed, read sas nahn . A slaves brand. You came for me, Amaram said, limping to the door, stepping around Reeshs body. For saving my life, I spare yours. Five men telling the same story would have been believed, but a single slave will be ignored. The warcamp will be told that you didnt try to help your fellowsbut you didnt try to stop them, either. You fled and were captured by my guard. Amaram hesitated by the door, resting the blunt edge of the stolen Shardblade on his shoulder. The guilt was still there in his eyes, but he grew hard, covering it. You are being discharged as a deserter and branded as a slave. But you are spared death by my mercy. He opened the door and walked out. The branding iron fell, searing Kaladins fate into his skin. He let out a final, ragged scream. THE END OF Part Three
